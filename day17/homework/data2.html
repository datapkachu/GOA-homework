    The Mercedes-Benz GLA is a subcompact luxury crossover SUV manufactured and marketed by Mercedes-Benz over two generations. It is essentially the SUV equivalent of the A-Class, and the smallest SUV marketed by the brand.[2][3] The production version was revealed in August 2013 ahead of the 2013 Frankfurt Auto Show in September 2013.[4]

    The GLA is powered by a range of petrol and diesel 4-cylinder engines, and comes in either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, the latter marketed by Mercedes as 4Matic.[5]

    The GLA nameplate aligns with Mercedes SUV nomenclature, where GL stands for Geländewagen (German for off-road vehicle) and the A designates its overall place in the Mercedes range, in this class, the smallest or A-Class.[6][7][8]

    The production X156 GLA is closely based on the Concept GLA design and was unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show.[16][17] Orders had been taken beginning from the end of November 2013, and arrived in dealer showrooms during 2014, with Japan and US in the autumn.[18]

    At launch, Mercedes-Benz claimed the vehicle was the most aerodynamic in its segment, with a Cd figure of 0.29.[19] The GLA's platform makes use of a strut-type front suspension and a multi-link rear setup, and an electric power steering.[20][21]

    Nissan marketed a restyled variant of the GLA from 2016 to 2019 through its Infiniti brand in North America as the Infiniti Q30 and QX30, sharing the GLA mechanicals with revised exterior sheet metal.[22] The Infiniti derivatives were produced between 2016 and 2019.

    Facelift
    Mercedes unveiled a mid-life facelift of the GLA at the Detroit Motor Show in January 2017. The updated model came with some cosmetic tweaks on the outside, including a redesigned grille, new front and rear bumpers and updated 18-inch alloy wheels. Moreover, the bi-xenon headlamps of the previous models were replaced by all LED units, while the taillights too were all LED and got a new design pattern. A new Canyon Beige colour option was also added. The interiors carried forward the same dashboard layout, though the infotainment system received a new 8.0-inch screen that was located on top of the centre console in a free-standing layout.[23]

    The second generation, introduced on 11 December 2019 at Mercedes media event,[30] is revised from the previous generation. The chassis number, 247, is shared with W247 B-Class and X247 GLB. The GLA uses the second generation MFA2 platform and completes the eight-model W177 A-Class compact based line-up.[31]

    The H247 GLA is 15 mm (0.59 in) shorter in length, 10 mm (0.39 in) narrower, 104 mm (4.1 in) higher than the first-generation model, and the wheelbase has been extended by 30 mm (1.2 in).[32] The H247 GLA has 116 mm more headroom, 45 mm more elbow room and 43 mm more rear shoulder room.[33] The ground clearance has been raised by 9 mm to 143 mm and the front seats are positioned 140 mm higher than in the W177 A-Class. Despite this, there is an added 22 mm (0.87 in) of front-seat headroom compared to its predecessor.[34]

    As with other MFA2-based models, the GLA has suspension with MacPherson struts up front and either a torsion beam or multi-link suspension at the rear. Variable damping control is optional.[34] Inside, the GLA is similar to other MFA2 Mercedes models, featuring a dashboard with a free-standing digital display panel, the MBUX infotainment system, as well as other tech such as a colour Heads-Up Display.[33]

    A battery electric version called the EQA was introduced in 2020 as the third battery electric SUV from Mercedes-Benz.[35]

    <p>The Mercedes-Benz GLE, formerly Mercedes-Benz M-Class (designated with the "ML" nomenclature), is a mid-size luxury SUV produced by the German manufacturer Mercedes-Benz since 1997. In terms of size, it is slotted in between the smaller GLC and the larger GLS, the latter with which it shares platforms.

    The first-generation M-Class, designated with the model code W163, is a body-on-frame SUV and was produced until 2004. The second-generation M-Class (W164) moved to a unibody platform while sharing most components with the GL-Class, which sports a longer body to accommodate third-row seating.

    For a short time, between 1999 and 2002, the W163 M-Class was also built by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria, for the European market, and the W166 M-Class from 2011 to 2015 was built in Stuttgart for the European and Australian market, before all production moved to the U.S. plant near Vance, Alabama in 2015 with the release of the facelifted W166 model, in an effort to harmonize Mercedes-Benz SUV nameplates by aligning it with the E-Class.

    Nomenclature update from M to GLE
    Although grouped under the "M-Class" naming banner since the first launch, BMW, who sells M models such as the M3, objected to the car being badged "M" with the three-digit engine level afterwards (e.g. M 320). This forced Mercedes-Benz to defer to a double-tiered marketing strategy of "ML" badging (e.g. ML 320) under an M-Class umbrella.[1] There has been some confusion surrounding this nomenclature, with many sources erroneously referring to the series as the "ML-Class",[2][3] including Mercedes-Benz itself.[4][5]

    From 2015, with the release of the facelifted W166 third-generation model at the New York Auto Show in April, the M-Class was renamed to GLE as per the revised nomenclature adopted by the brand. Under this scheme, SUVs use the base name "GL", followed by the model's placement in Mercedes-Benz hierarchy. The "G" is for Geländewagen (German for off land wagon or off-road vehicle) and alludes the long-running G-Wagen. This is followed by the letter "L" that acts as a linkage with the letter "E"—the GLE being the SUV equivalent to the E-Class.[6][7]

    Development
    Mercedes-Benz proposed a plan to replace the G-Class, which at the time had been in production for 11 years. A joint agreement with Mitsubishi Motors to develop and produce a sports-utility vehicle was made in early 1991 and was confirmed publicly that June. Plans were made to base it on the Montero/Pajero platform, with one of them being badged as a Mercedes-Benz and the other a Mitsubishi. In May 1992, these plans were abandoned citing "technical problems" and Mercedes-Benz continued on with in-house development from January 1993.[10][11]

    In March 1993, a search for a location to build a U.S. manufacturing plant began. By September 1993, a location in the state of Alabama was chosen and construction started in 1994.

    While plans were being made overseas, in Germany development continued. Design work took place from late 1992 to 1994. A design from Mercedes' Sindelfingen studio was chosen in 1993 and approved by the executive board in February 1994. The design patents were filed in Germany on 13 July 1994, and in the U.S. on 13 January 1995. Prototype testing started with test mules and crash tests using mock-ups in May 1994. First functional prototype's crash test took place in February 1995, with full testing run from March 1995 to December 1996 in various climates and regions of the world. Pilot production began in May 1996.

    In July 1996, construction on the Mercedes-Benz U.S. International plant in Vance, Alabama concluded, with the very first production M-Class rolling off the assembly line the week of 9 February 1997.[12]

    Launch
    Mercedes-Benz launched the first generation W163 series M-Class on 19 February 1997, in the United States for the 1998 model year, with sales beginning that September. It is a mid-sized body-on-frame SUV with seating for five, or seven with an optional third-row, seven-seat version. Access to the third-row was deemed problematic and the seats were not suitable for large adults. As a result, the seven seater M-Class was discontinued after the 2005 model year and replaced by the larger GL-Class.

    The Mercedes-Benz M-Class (W163) was available with permanent 4Matic four-wheel drive, which routed torque to all four wheels through open front, center, and rear differentials.[13] The system used a two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4409 transfer case with a planetary center differential that provides a 48% front/52% rear default torque split. The transfer case featured reduction gearing, and Mercedes' new Four-wheel Electronic Traction System (4-ETS). 4-ETS simulated three differential locks on all three open differentials, via aggressively braking one or more spinning wheels.[13]

    The M-Class was the first luxury SUV to feature electronic stability control, a system designed to detect loss of control and instantaneously intervene with selective braking to bring the vehicle back on its intended course. Furthermore, the M-Class featured front- and side-impact airbags with advanced occupant detection for the front passenger seat, which helped earn the W163 the highest marks in insurance industry crash tests.

    Manufactured in Vance, Alabama, in the United States, the M-Class launched in the North American market first as the ML 320. The ML 320 was sold internationally, with the "320" suffix alluding to the 3.2-liter V6 engine. An entry-level, manual transmission-only ML 230, fitted with a 2.3-liter inline-four was available in Europe from launch in March 1998 until 2000. From launch in 1998, European markets also received the ML 270 CDI with a 2.7-liter inline-five turbodiesel engine. This unit was made available in Australia in 2000 and continued on in the W163 until being replaced upon the release of the W164 M-Class in 2005.

    Later, in 1998, the more powerful ML 430 became available with the newly introduced Mercedes-Benz 4.3-liter V8. This was followed by the February 1999 debut of the 2000 ML 55 AMG, featuring a 5.4-liter V8 engine made by AMG, modified bodywork, and other performance features.


    Mercedes-Benz ML 320 used in The Lost World: Jurassic Park in the Mercedes-Benz Museum.
    In September 1996, before the vehicle was launched, Mercedes-Benz allowed the producers of the 1997 film The Lost World: Jurassic Park to make use of modified pre-production M-Class SUVs as a way to advertise the W163 when it was launched in 1997. As a result, a Mercedes-Benz advertisement appears before the film on original VHS copies of the film. Jeff Goldblum, the star of the film, received a complimentary ML 320 from Mercedes-Benz as a result of the tie-in. Three versions were used in the movie, two of which of each were built. Two are displayed at the Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, there is one at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany, and one at the Visitor Center at the M-class factory in Alabama.

    Awards
    The ML 320 was Motor Trend magazine's Truck of the Year for 1998 and was voted the 1998 North American Truck of the Year at the North American International Auto Show, Detroit, in January 1998. It also received the World Car Award in March 1999, voted by an international jury of automotive journalists in Geneva.[14] Despite the accolades, Mercedes-Benz received considerable criticism with respect to the substandard quality of the W163, resulting in the car being nicknamed Alabama Trashcan.[15] Quality improved over the years, especially after the facelift in 2001 for the 2002 model year. DaimlerChrysler spent US$600 million (~$900 million in 2023) on improvements at the Alabama factory before launching the second generation ML in 2005.

    Facelift


    2001 facelift
    Mercedes-Benz revised and updated the W163 in 2001 for the 2002 model year. Styling updates involved the fitment of new head- and tail-lamp lenses, front and rear bumpers, new alloy wheels on most variants, the relocation of the side turn signals from the fenders to the side-view mirrors, and various interior trim changes. At the same time, the ML 430 was replaced by the 5.0-liter V8-powered ML 500 and a new 4.0-liter V8 turbodiesel ML 400 CDI became available in Europe. The following year, in 2002, Mercedes-Benz launched the ML 350 fitted with a 3.7-liter V6 engine. The ML 350 replaced the ML 320 in some markets, but supplemented it in others.

    The previous Popemobile was based on a W163 series ML 430 and has been in service since July 2002.[16] Volkswagen had offered to build a new vehicle based on the Touareg, but Pope Benedict XVI opted to continue using his predecessor's Mercedes-Benz-manufactured vehicle.[17]

    Pre-facelift Mercedes-Benz ML 320 CDI (Australia)


    Mercedes-Benz ML 63 AMG (Australia; pre-facelift)
    In 1999, development on a successor to the W163 began under the codename "W164" and spanned a period of six years. First design drafts appeared in 2000 with the first models in scale 1:4, and in 2001 three full-sized models were prepared.[21] In 2002 the design styled by Steve Mattin under Peter Pfeiffer was chosen and approved by the executive board.[22] Design patents were filed in Germany on 10 June 2003 and in the U.S. on 25 July. Prototype testing was conducted throughout 2003 and 2004, concluding in early 2005. The redesigned M-class (chassis name W164) was introduced in April 2005 as a 2006 model after a showing at the North American International Auto Show in January. It was almost entirely new, with a more sporting, aerodynamic look. The coefficient of drag was reduced to 0.34. Mercedes-Benz made the new M-Class 71 mm larger, 150 mm longer and 5 mm lower than the first model. The M-Class was named "Best New Sport Utility Vehicle" in the 2006 Canadian Car of the Year awards.

    Mercedes-Benz extensively publicised the US$600 million spent to update its factory and add manufacturing space for the new R-Class. According to early automotive press reports, the 2006 M-Class vehicles demonstrated vast improvements in quality.

    The W164 platform used for the new M-Class is shared with the new GL-Class and is a unibody type rather than the former (W163) body-on-frame used by the M-Class vehicles produced from 1998–2005. The X164 GL-Class, a longer seven-seater version of the W164 platform, is also available.

    New features in the 2006 M-Class include the 7G-Tronic seven-speed automatic transmission, optional Active Curve-Illuminating Bi-Xenon headlights which "steer" in the path of the vehicle, and an adjustable-height air suspension. The manual transmission has been dropped. Permanent 4Matic four-wheel drive remained, with one-speed transfer case (no low range), center limited-slip differential and four-wheel electronic traction system (4-ETS). In most countries except the U.S., an Off-Road Pro package with center and rear differential locks, 4-ETS, two-speed transfer case with reduction gearing, and adjustable ground clearance was available as an option increasing the original fording depth from 500 mm to 600 mm.

    The AMG version of the W164, the ML 63 AMG, was introduced at the 2006 North American International Auto Show as a limited edition 2007 model. It features a 6.2 L M156 V8 engine producing 510 PS (375 kW) and 465 lb⋅ft (630 N⋅m) that is handcrafted in Germany. The engine is added to an AMG SpeedShift 7G-Tronic seven-speed automatic transmission. The 2006 ML 63 AMG can accelerate from 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 4.8 seconds, or from 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) in 5.0 seconds. These features made the ML 63 AMG the most powerful naturally aspirated V8 SUV in the world at the time of its launch.[26]

    2008 facelift

    Interior


    2008 facelift (ML 63 AMG)
    By 2007, design work on updates to the W164 were finalized and patented domestically in Germany on 23 November 2007. The 2009 Mercedes-Benz M-Class got a minor facelift as it debuted at the 2008 New York International Auto Show in March 2008.

    This facelift includes new front headlights, redesigned front and rear bumpers, new exterior mirrors, new rim choices, a larger front grille, restyled interior, and a new ML 420 CDI engine choice. The ML 280 CDI became the ML 300 CDI, the 320 CDI became the 350 CDI, and the 420 CDI became the 450 CDI.

    Models using Bluetec Diesel engine with urea injection were introduced in 2008 for the 2009 model year.

    At the 2009 New York International Auto Show, Mercedes-Benz showed their ML 450 Hybrid SUV, which was announced on 8 April 2009. The ML 450 Hybrid consumes almost 50% less fuel than the ML 550 does, even though it produces over 90% of the power generated by the V8 model. Total power generated will be 335 hp (250 kW) and 381 lb⋅ft (517 N⋅m) of torque, while getting 24 mpg‑US (9.8 L/100 km) on the highway and 21 mpg‑US (11 L/100 km) in the city, according to United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates. The engine itself runs on the Atkinson cycle and by itself makes 275 hp.[27] The ML 450 was developed under the Global Hybrid Cooperation, and will only be available in the United States under lease.[28][29]

    In 2011, Mercedes-Benz came out with the M-Class BlueTec Grand Edition. The vehicle had cosmetic changes, including specially-manufactured 22-inch 10 spoke wheels, black leather with white stitching, and smokers package with Grand Edition modeling. The exterior consisted of new wheels, tinted headlights and tail lights, xenon-package (LED tail lights and daytime running lights, Xenon headlights), black grille, AMG, and side-view mirrors. The Grand Edition was offered in Midnight Blue, Black, and Ivory White, differentiating the basic model by color already. The interior featured an AMG steering wheel in place of the standard heated steering wheel.

    Mercedes-Benz ML 250 BlueTEC (Australia)


    Mercedes-Benz ML 63 AMG

    Interior
    In 2006, development began on the next-generation M-Class and spanned over a period of 5 years, a shorter duration than its predecessor. In 2008, the final design by Emiel Burki was approved and patented domestically on 16 December 2008 (U.S. design patent filed on 15 June 2009). The newly redesigned M-Class (chassis name W166) was introduced in pre-production form 10 June 2011 as a 2012 model. The first customer-designated W166 rolled off the Vance production line on 20 July.[34] It is moderately refined, taking styling cues from the new generation Mercedes-Benz E-Class. An increase in rear seat legroom has been implemented, alongside adjustable rear backrests. It was to be launched in September 2011.

    New features in the 2012 M-Class include an updated 7G-Tronic Plus seven-speed automatic transmission to provide improved fuel economy, optional adaptive cruise control (Distronic Plus), active lane departure warning system, and an adjustable-height air suspension (AirMatic). An active curve system with active anti-roll bars for body roll compensation was introduced.[35]

    The W166 was one of the last vestiges of the joint venture between Daimler and Chrysler while they were a consolidated company. DaimlerChrysler developed the core platform and technology, benefitting from Chrysler's strong SUV sales and R&D domestically. The underlying platform work was largely completed in 2006, as the two companies were separated. Chrysler uses the same platform to power the Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2) and Dodge Durango. Because of the separation however, the cars are extremely different in terms of interior and body design as well as engine choices. Aside from engines, the three SUVs share many powertrain components, including some transmissions.

    An On&Off Road Package is available for most markets (including North America) as of the 2013 model year. The package adds a two-speed dual range Magna Powertrain transfer case with center differential lock, reduction gearing, underbody skid plates, and a 6-mode selectable terrain driving program system. The rear differential lock has been discontinued.[36]

    Open front and rear differentials are fitted, and use four-wheel electronic traction system (4-ETS) to simulate front and rear differential locks.

    The Mercedes M-Class won first place in the "Luxury Crossover SUV" category and has been named the most ideal vehicle for Americans based on a study undertaken by California-based automotive research and consulting firm AutoPacific.[37]

    Mercedes-Benz India established a manufacturing plant in Chakan, Pune in early 2009[38] that rolled out the first W166 M-Class to be built outside the US in October 2012.[39] In the following month, Mercedes-Benz Indonesia began M-Class assembly at a factory in Wanaherang, West Java.[40] These plants perform final assembly of vehicles shipped as "knocked-down" kits from Vance, USA.

    In the second half of 2015 a facelifted W166 was released as the GLE, along with a coupé version.

    The previous Popemobile was based on the 2012 M-Class and was delivered in December 2012.

    Facelift (GLE)

    Mercedes-Benz Concept Coupé SUV
    The GLE name was used in 2015 for the facelifted W166[42] along with the new five-door coupé derivative GLE Coupé (C292) which was unveiled to the public in January 2015 at the North American International Auto Show. As part of Mercedes-Benz's new naming strategy, the GLE will define the SUV's positioning in the middle of its segment and between the future GLC and GLS (the former GLK and GL, respectively), the same way the E-Class is positioned in relation to the C and S-Classes.

    The fourth generation GLE was unveiled at the 2018 Paris Motor Show.

    At launch, the GLE was sold in the U.S. with two engine options. The GLE 350 has a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine with 255 hp (259 PS; 190 kW) and the GLE 450 has a 3.0-liter, inline-6, turbocharged engine with 362 hp (367 PS; 270 kW) and 369 lb⋅ft (500 N⋅m) of torque. The GLE 450 has a 48V electric system with an integrated starter motor. The system powers the air-conditioner, in-car electronics and the electronically driven turbocharger.[58] The GLE 450 features a refined Active Body Control system, that does away with mechanical roll bars, notably enhancing performance.[58]

    Other engine options are also available. The AMG GLE 53 was introduced at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show in March. It has a 3.0 L turbocharged I6 producing 429 hp (435 PS; 320 kW) and 384 lb⋅ft (521 N⋅m) of torque. A 48V electric system like in the GLE 450 features EQ Boost for an extra 21 hp (16 kW) and 184 lb⋅ft (249 N⋅m) torque on demand.[59]

    For the first time under the "GLE" name, the GLE also adds a seven-seat option.

    Plug-in hybrid
    In the European market, two plug-in hybrid versions are available: the GLE 350e, using a gasoline engine, and the GLE 350de, using a diesel engine. Both use a 31.2-kWh battery. The vehicle can be equipped with a 60 kW quick charging option. The declared WLTP all-electric range is 90 to 99 km (56 to 62 mi).[60][61]

    Recall
    In March 2024, Mercedes-Benz recalled over 116,000 GLE and GLS cars, built from 2019 to 2024, due to a loose 48-volt ground cable that may not have been tightened properly during assembly. The ground cable is located under the front passenger seat that could pose a potential safety risk when the cables become hot.[67]

    <p>The Mercedes-AMG GT is a series of 2-door sports cars produced by German automobile manufacturer Mercedes-AMG. The car was introduced on 9 September 2014 and was officially unveiled to the public in October 2014 at the Paris Motor Show.[1] While not directly replacing the SLS AMG (competing in a different segment), it is the second sports car developed entirely in-house by Mercedes-AMG. The Mercedes-AMG GT went on sale in two variants (GT and GT S) in March 2015, while a GT3 racing variant of the car was introduced in 2015. A high performance variant called the GT R was introduced in 2016. A GT4 racing variant, targeted at semi-professional drivers and based on the GT R variant, was introduced in 2017. In 2021, a new variant called the AMG GT Black Series was released. All variants are assembled at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Sindelfingen, Germany.

    The first-generation AMG GT in October 2021.[clarification needed] That same month, Mercedes-Benz announced the new Mercedes-AMG R232 SL-Class as the direct successor for the roadster version.[2][3][4] The second-generation coupe version of the GT, which was introduced nearly a year after the first-generation was discontinued, was redesigned on the same platform as the SL, but retains the name AMG GT.

    Mercedes-AMG GT S
    The interior of the Mercedes-AMG GT was previewed on 16 April 2014.[12] The car made its debut on 9 September 2014 and was officially unveiled to the public in October 2014 at the Paris Motor Show. The GT's exterior design was kept similar to that of the preceding SLS AMG, with wide wheel arches, lower bodywork, and fastback sloping roofline of the SLS AMG, but using conventional forward-opening doors instead of the iconic gullwing style pioneered by the 300 SL in the 1950s. It also employed an upgraded and shortened version of the Transaxle Spaceframe platform used by the SLS.[13]

    The vehicle structure is made up of 93% aluminium, with the front module base made up of magnesium.[14] The exterior lead designer was Mark Fetherston, whose previous works include the W176 A-Class, the CLA-Class, and SLS AMG.[8] The interior, designed by Jan Kaul, features a large centre console and decorative elements in a leather and carbon polymer design.[9] The trunk offers room for a medium-sized suitcase.

    Two engine power output options were offered: the GT, with 340 kW (462 PS; 456 hp), and the GT S with 375 kW (510 PS; 503 hp).[1] The GT generates 600 N⋅m (443 lb⋅ft) of torque, and the GT S generates 650 N⋅m (479 lb⋅ft) of torque.[1]

    Shortly after its introduction, Mercedes-AMG CEO at the time, Tobias Moers promised a Black Series variant of the Mercedes-AMG GT.[15] The new high performance variant was called the AMG GT R.[16]

    2017 facelift
    The Mercedes-AMG family was given a facelift in 2017, along with the introduction of the GT C roadster variant and the Edition 50 model, which is a limited-edition derivative of the GT C variant. The key improvements made as part of the facelift include increased power output from the M178 engine for the GT and GT S variants (10 kW and 9 kW respectively)[17] and the inclusion of the 'Panamericana' grille from the GT3, GT4 and GT R variants as standard equipment for all variants.[18]

    Specifications and performance

    Mercedes-AMG GT S (C190) interior
    The GT uses a front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, with the engine positioned inside the vehicle's wheelbase (behind the front axis). The spaceframe chassis and body are made out of aluminium alloys, while the trunk lid is made of steel and the hood is made of magnesium.[1] The suspension system is a double wishbone unit at the front and rear, with forged aluminium wishbones and hub carriers.

    The car is powered by a 4.0-litre M178 twin-turbocharged V8 engine. The engine is in "hot inside V" configuration—with exhaust manifolds and turbochargers inside the cylinder banks to reduce turbo lag—and uses dry-sump lubrication. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed AMG SPEEDSHIFT dual-clutch transmission; the GT S variant employs an electronically controlled mechanical limited-slip differential.[19] In a road test executed by Car and Driver, the GT S accelerated from 0–97 km/h (60 mph) in 3.0 seconds, completed the quarter mile in 11.2 seconds and attained a top speed of 311 km/h (193 mph).[20]

    Variants
    F1 Safety Car

    Mercedes-AMG GT S Formula 1 safety car
    The GT S was the Formula 1 safety car for the 2015, 2016 and 2017 seasons, having made its debut in that role at the 2015 Australian Grand Prix.[21][22] The GT R was used as F1's safety car from 2018 to 2021.[23] Since 2022, the GT R was replaced by the Black Series.[24]

    Mercedes-AMG GT (2015–2021)
    The GT is the entry level variant of the Mercedes-AMG GT family. The M178 engine in this variant is tuned to an output of 340 kW (462 PS; 456 hp) and 601 N⋅m (443 lb⋅ft) of torque, with the key differences between this and its more expensive siblings being a mechanical limited-slip differential, an absorbent glass mat battery, the lack of the "Race Mode" setting in the AMG Dynamic Select adaptive drivetrain system, the lack of the AMG Ride Control adaptive suspensive system, and a passive AMG Sport Exhaust System. Keyless-Go is also an optional feature, as opposed to standard equipment. The GT is equipped with 19-inch wheels at the front and rear.

    Mercedes-AMG GT S (2015–2020)

    Mercedes-AMG GT S
    The GT S is a more highly equipped variant of the Mercedes-AMG GT. The M178 engine in this variant is tuned to an output of 375 kW (510 PS; 503 hp) and 651 N⋅m (480 lb⋅ft) of torque. The key mechanical differences the GT S gains over the GT include an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, "Race Mode" and "Race Start" mode settings in the AMG Dynamic Select adaptive drivetrain system, AMG Ride Control adaptive suspensive system, an AMG Performance Exhaust System with dynamic flaps, and a lithium-ion battery. Keyless-Go is standard equipment, as is a staggered set of wheels (19-inch at the front, 20-inch at the rear).

    As with many other recent Mercedes-AMGs, at the time of introduction a limited production "Edition 1" series was issued of the GT S. 375 examples were sold worldwide, and include a gloss black aerodynamic set including a front splitter, lower wheelwell extensions, a carbon fibre roof, a fixed rear wing, red interior accents and red brake calipers, and various other extras.[25]

    Mercedes-AMG GT C (2017–2021)
    The GT C is a performance oriented variant of the Mercedes-AMG GT. The M178 engine in this variant is tuned to an output of 410 kW (557 PS; 550 hp) and 502 lb⋅ft (681 N⋅m) of torque. While the GT C retains the key mechanical differences the GT S gains over the GT, it also has a wider body (2,007 mm (79 in)) and active rear steering, which the GT S does not have (even as options). In the United States, the Lane Tracking and AMG Dynamic Plus option packages are standard equipment on the GT C.

    A limited-edition model, the Edition 50, was released as part of the debut of the GT C variant at the 2017 Detroit Auto Show. The Edition 50 features: a choice of two shades of matte paint known as designo Graphite Grey Magno and designo Cashmere White Magno; black chrome exterior trim, headlight surrounds and forged / cross-spoke wheels; a two-tone silver pearl or black against grey quilted-leather interior which features a micro-suede wrapped steering wheel; and, "Edition 50" and "1 of 500" lettering on the steering wheel bezel and 12 o'clock mark in silver pearl. In the United States, the Edition 50 is limited in production to 50 coupes and 50 roadsters. Globally, the Edition 50 is limited to 500 units, which explains the "1 of 500" on the steering wheel.[26][27][18]

    Mercedes-AMG GT R (2017–2021)

    Mercedes-AMG GT R

    Mercedes-AMG GT R Roadster at Geneva International Motor Show 2019
    The GT R is a high-performance variant of the Mercedes-AMG GT and was introduced at the Goodwood Festival of Speed on 24 June 2016. The M178 engine in this variant is tuned to an output of 430 kW (585 PS; 577 hp) at 6,250 rpm and 700 N⋅m (516 lb⋅ft) of torque at 5,500 rpm. The GT R accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.6 seconds and has a claimed top speed of 319 km/h (198 mph).[28]

    While the GT R retains the key mechanical differences the GT C gains over the GT S, it also gains manually adjustable coilover springs (in conjunction with the AMG Ride Control suspension of the base models), an active underbody fairing, a manually adjustable rear wing, and a 9-mode AMG Traction Control system. As befitting of a high-performance variant, the GT R loses Keyless-Go, the integrated garage-door opener, the heated and power-folding side mirrors, the auto-dimming interior and exterior mirrors and reverts to the basic light-weight 4-speaker audio system that the GT comes with, but these features can still be added as options.

    When it was launched, the GT R had several cosmetic changes compared with the standard car, notably the vertical slats in the front grille, an adjustable rear wing, new front air intakes and new front and rear diffusers. The styling of the GT R is more comparable to that of the AMG GT3 race car. However, the base GT variant gained several of these cosmetic changes as part of a mild facelift in the 2017 model year. The GT R went on sale in November 2016, with deliveries beginning in 2017.[29] For the 2018 Formula One World Championship, the GT R became the official Formula 1 safety car. During the 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix, the Safety Car ran a red livery rather than the traditional silver to commemorate Scuderia Ferrari's 1,000th Grand Prix start. For the 2021 F1 season, the GT R Safety Car permanently wears a red livery (along with the Mercedes F1 Team's sponsor CrowdStrike) rather than the traditional silver to increase the chances of drivers seeing the Safety Car in poor visibility. It will also share the role with the Aston Martin Vantage.

    It completed a lap of the Nürburgring Nordschleife track in 7:10.92, in a test conducted by German magazine Sport Auto,[30] making it the fastest rear wheel driven road-legal production car around the track at the time[31] and the 5th fastest lap time for a road-legal production vehicle around the track at the time.[citation needed]

    A roadster version was introduced in March 2019 and would be limited to 750 units.[32] It was discontinued in 2021 when the Black Edition was released which it replaced.[clarification needed]

    Mercedes-AMG GT R Pro (2019–2020)

    Mercedes-AMG GT R Pro
    Mercedes-AMG introduced the GT R Pro at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show. The GT R Pro is a more track focused variant of the AMG GT line up and based on the GT R. This variant would be limited for 750 units worldwide with a starting price tag of USD $200,645. The GT R Pro retains all key mechanical differences of the GT R gains over the GT C with other minor upgrades, the GT R Pro uses the same engine and power output of the GT R, which is rated at 430 kW (585 PS; 577 hp) at 6,250 rpm and 700 N⋅m (516 lb⋅ft) of torque at 5,500 rpm. And retains the same 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) time 3.6 seconds and the top speed of 319 km/h (198 mph).

    New upgrades includes, new manually adjustable coil-over suspension setup, lightweight anti-roll bars, electronically controlled dynamic engine and transmission mounts, GT R's optional carbon-fiber roof and carbon ceramic brakes became standard, new carbon-fibre bucket seats, lightweight forged wheels 19-inch on front and 20-inch on rear which were exclusive for the GT R Pro, same Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 semi-slick tires which were also used in the GT R, new carbon-fibre braced active aerodynamic front splitter and canards, new front fenders with GT3 inspired vents, new rear diffuser with canards, new side skirts, updated rear wing with a small gurney for increase downforce while reducing weight.

    Interior upgrades includes, a 10.25-inch digital instrument binnacle and infotainment system, a Burmester surround sound system, keyless go and parking assist. On exterior, new racing stripes offered in Gloss Light Green when combined with the Selenite Gray Magno color exterior, or stripes in Matte Dark Gray with all other exterior colors. The unique accent stripes can also offered for the GT R Pro.

    For the GT R Pro, Mercedes-AMG also offered an optional track package which adds a full steel roll-cage, four-point harnesses and a 2 kg fire extinguisher. With all these upgrades curb weight has been reduced by 25 kg (55 lb), and with track package equipped 40 kg (88 lb) of weight reduced over the GT R.

    In November 2018, Mercedes-AMG conducted a test at Nürburgring Nordschleife for the new GT R Pro, and the car completed a lap time, driven by Maro Engel, set a lap time of 7:04.632 minutes around the track, making it the 8th fastest lap time for a road-legal production vehicle around the track at the time.[33][34]

    Mercedes-AMG GT and GT C Roadster (2017–2021)

    Mercedes-AMG GT C Roadster
    The GT and GT C roadsters are the roadster versions of the GT and GT C coupés, and were announced shortly after the introduction of the GT R variant.[35] Both variants made their debut at the 2016 Paris Motor Show. The GT and GT C roadsters utilise the active air management system found on the GT R variant to help with cooling and airflow performance. The GT C roadster retains the wider bodywork of the GT C coupé, and the GT roadster has a slightly higher first and lower seventh gear with a longer final drive compared to the GT coupé. The GT and GT C roadsters feature a three-layer fabric roof built around an aluminum, magnesium and steel structure, available in black, red or beige, and which can open and close in 11 seconds up to speeds of 50 km/h (31 mph). The GT C roadster, like the GT C coupé, has a limited "Edition 50" model, celebrating AMG's 50 years of existence.[36][35]

    Mercedes-AMG GT Dark Night Edition (2021)
    Mercedes-AMG official announced that its AMG GT Black Series and AMG GT Dark night officially listed special edition models, Mercedes-AMG GT models launched a total of 2, The prices are US$576,612 and $229,594.[37]

    Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series (2021–2023)

    Shmee150's Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series
    The GT Black Series is a high-performance variant of the Mercedes-AMG GT and was officially revealed on Mercedes-AMG's YouTube channel on 9 July 2020. The M178 engine in this variant is tuned to an output of 537 kW (730 PS; 720 hp) at 6,700–6,900 rpm and 800 N⋅m (590 lb⋅ft) of torque at 2,000–6,000 rpm. Referred to as the M178 LS2, the engine has a slightly higher redline at 7,200 rpm compared to the GT R's 7,000 rpm, and uses a flat-plane crankshaft instead of a cross-plane crankshaft, turning out in different firing order. Additionally, the M178 LS2 uses a smaller compressor wheel, resulting in an increase in boost from the GT R's 135 to 170 kPa (19.6 to 24.6 psi). The GT Black Series accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.2 seconds though it was tested at 3.0 seconds and has a claimed top speed of 325 km/h (202 mph).[38]

    The suspension is unique, with a carbon-fibre anti-roll bar with two adjustment settings for the front axle, and an iron anti-roll bar with three adjustment settings for the rear axle. Like previous Black Series vehicles, the camber is manually adjustable for both the front and rear axles. Handling has been improved with carbon-fibre panels at the front and rear, as well as carbon-ceramic brake rotors and Black Series specific brake pads. The wing has an active aero flap, and contributes to a total maximum downforce of more than 400 kg (882 lb) at 249 km/h (155 mph). The Michelin Pilot Cup 2 R tires are specific to the car, and are available in M01A soft and M02 hard compounds.[39]

    Carbon-fibre is used extensively for most of the body, including the hood, roof, hatch and underbody. The exterior gains an enlarged grille based on the Mercedes-AMG GT3, as well as bigger air outlets, a manually adjustable front splitter and an upgraded rear wing as part of a major aerodynamic upgrade. The interior features standard AMG performance bucket seats, and uses microfiber for the steering wheel, door and instrument panels.[40]

    On 4 November 2020, the GT Black Series recorded a lap time of 6:43.616 with Maro Engel behind the wheel at the Nürburgring Nordschleife, making it the fastest lap time ever recorded for a road-legal production vehicle around the track at the time.

    In March 2015, Mercedes-AMG presented the AMG GT3, a race version of the GT, at the Geneva Motor Show, which employs the M159 6,208 cc (378.8 cu in) V8 naturally aspirated engine also used in the SLS AMG GT3. It consists largely of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer to decrease the vehicle's weight to under 1,300 kg (2,866 lb) to comply with FIA regulations for races.[55] In 2016, AKKA ASP, Black Falcon, HTP Motorsport and Zakspeed competed in the Blancpain Endurance Series. Zakspeed also competed in the ADAC GT Masters. They claimed a 1-2-3-4 and 6 at the 24 Hours Nürburgring.

    In the 2016 Super GT GT300 class, the AMG GT3s made their Super GT debut with Good Smile Racing with Team UKYO, the number 11 GAINER team, LEON Racing, and Rn-sports opting to use the AMG GT3s in favor of the SLS AMG GT3s that they used in the previous season. Two Mercedes customer teams, R'Qs Motor Sports and Arnage Racing, opted to continue using the SLS AMG GT3s. Both of them would switch to AMG GT3s during the 2018 season, switching from SLS AMG GT3 and Ferrari 488 GT3 respectively.

    New Zealand born driver Craig Baird gave the new AMG GT3 its first race win anywhere when he took out race 1 of round 2 of the 2016 Australian GT Championship at the Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit on 17 March 2016.[56] The round was held as a support race to the 2016 Australian Grand Prix.

    Riley Technologies entered two customer AMG GT3s in the 2017 IMSA SportsCar Championship GTD class. One of the teams cars finished 3rd in class and 20th outright at the 2017 24 Hours of Daytona before going on to win the GTD class and finish 16th outright in the 2017 12 Hours of Sebring. As of June 2019, a total of 130 GT3 cars were sold.[57]

    AMG GT4 (2017–present)

    AMG GT4 of Murillo Racing
    A GT4 version of the Mercedes-AMG GT was presented at the 2017 24 Hours of Spa. This customer racing car is based on the GT R road version and it made its debut in the ROWE 6 Stunden ADAC Ruhr-Pokal-Rennen race, the fifth round of the 2017 VLN season.[58][59] The car received significant upgrades for the 2022 season.[60]

    AMG GT3 Evo (2020–present)

    AMG GT3 Evo of Ram Racing
    An updated version of the GT3 was introduced at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring in June 2019 for the 2020 season of the FIA GT3 category. New technologies include an automatic data logger and analysis system, a function to automatically start the engine when the car is lowered from its in-built air jacks along with new brake and traction control systems. The design was also updated in line with the design of the new design update of the AMG GT road car with the changes being the new headlamps and the grille with the latter providing better protection for the radiator. The front splitter and rear wing were tweaked in order for faster adjustments. The car uses the same 6.2-litre V8 engine as the previous model rather than the 4.0-litre V8 engine of the road car, its engineers stating the user friendliness and reliability of the engine as the main factor of its retention.[61]

    The car's eligibility for the FIA World Endurance Championship's LM GT3 class starting from 2025 will mark the marque's return to the 24 Hours of Le Mans since 1999, after the Mercedes-Benz CLR backflip incidents.[62]

    AMG GT2 (2023–present)
    The Mercedes-AMG GT2 was unveiled in December 2022, created for participation in the SRO GT2 category. The car features a 707 bhp 4.0-liter biturbo V8 AMG engine, making it the most powerful customer Mercedes car yet.[63] The car made its racing debut during the first round of the 2023 GT2 European Series at Monza, and won its first race during the second round at the Red Bull Ring.[64]

    <p>The Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class is a compact executive roadster, produced by Mercedes-Benz. It was released in 1996 and was manufactured at the Mercedes plant in Bremen, Germany, until 2020.

    The former name "SLK" was derived from sportlich (sporty), leicht (lightweight), and kurz (short).[1] With the release of the facelift R172 in 2016, the SLK-Class was renamed to SLC-Class in accordance with the revised nomenclature adopted by Mercedes. Under this scheme, roadsters use the base name "SL", followed by the model's placement in Mercedes-Benz hierarchy, the letter "C", being the roadster equivalent to the C-Class.[2][3]

    First generation (R170; 1995–2004)
    Main article: Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class (R170)

    R170 SLK-Class
    The R170 Mercedes SLK was the first generation compact roadster manufactured and marketed by Mercedes, from 1995 to 2004.[4][5] It was designed from late 1991 under Bruno Sacco, with a final design being completed in early 1993 and approved by the board, with a German design patent filed on September 30, 1993.[6] The production SLK-Class was introduced at the Turin Motor Show on 22 April 1996, appearing as a modern incarnation of the 1950s Mercedes-Benz 190SL, by returning to four cylinders and with an identical 94-inch (2,400 mm) wheelbase.[7] A facelift was introduced to all models in 2000, featuring an updated design and updated engines.[8]

    Second generation (R171; 2004–2010)
    Main article: Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class (R171)

    R171 SLK-Class
    The R171 SLK was unveiled at the 2004 Geneva Motor Show. It features increased use of high-strength steel,[9] and improvements to the car's torsional strength and aerodynamic efficiency.[9] Models feature a more compact, revised roof mechanism that is operated in 22 seconds (previously 25 seconds), resulting in an increase in boot capacity by 63 liters (2.2 cu ft).[9] The R171 also introduced the Airscarf system that integrates neck-level heating system into the headrests of the car.[9] The front-end design of the car was inspired by the noses found in Formula One cars.[9] It was facelifted in 2008 and featured new engines and minor exterior design changes.[10]

    Third generation (R172; 2011–2020)

    The R172 SLK was released in 2011.[11] It was available with a range of inline-four, V6, and V8, diesel and petrol engines, and introduced an electronically operated window tint shade for the sunroof, called Magic Sky Control. A facelift was released for vehicles produced from March 2016, to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the SLK-Class.[12] The model range was also renamed to SLC-Class to conform to the new Mercedes nomenclature, and introduced new engines and a revised design. In 2020, Mercedes-Benz released a Final Edition to commemorate the end of the car's production run.[13]
