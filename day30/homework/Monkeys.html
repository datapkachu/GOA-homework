            <p>The Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata), also known as the snow monkey, is a terrestrial Old World monkey species that is native to Japan. Colloquially, they are referred to as "snow monkeys" because some live in areas where snow covers the ground for months each year – no other non-human primate lives farther north, nor in a colder climate.[3] Individuals have brownish grey fur, pinkish-red faces, and short tails. Two subspecies are known.[4]

            In Japan, the species is known as Nihonzaru (ニホンザル, a combination of Nihon 日本 "Japan" + saru 猿 "monkey") to distinguish it from other primates, but the Japanese macaque is very familiar in Japan—as it is the only species of monkey in Japan—so when Japanese people simply say saru, they usually have the Japanese macaque in mind.

            Physical characteristics

            Skull of a Japanese macaque
            The Japanese macaque is sexually dimorphic. Males weigh on average 11.3 kg (25 lb), while females average 8.4 kg (19 lb).[5] Macaques from colder areas tend to weigh more than ones from warmer areas.[6] The average height for males is 57.0 cm (22.4 in), while the average female height is 52.3 cm (20.6 in).[5] The weight of their brain is approximately 95 g (3.4 oz). Japanese macaques have short stumps for tails that average 92.5 mm (3.64 in) in males and 79.1 mm (3.11 in) in females.[6] The macaque has a pinkish face and posterior.[7] The rest of its body is covered in brown or greyish hair.[5] The coat of the macaque is well-adapted to the cold and its thickness increases as temperatures decrease. The macaque can cope with temperatures as low as −20 °C (−4 °F).[8]

            Macaques mostly move on all fours. They are semiterrestrial, with females spending more time in the trees and males spending more time on the ground. Macaques are known to leap. They are very good swimmers and have been reported to swim a distance of more than half a kilometer.[5][9] The lifespan of Japanese macaques is up to 32 years for females and up to 28 years for males, which is high when compared to what typically is seen in other macaque species.[10]

            Japanese macaques grooming
            Japanese macaques live in matrilineal societies,[5] and females stay in their natal groups for life, while males move out before they are sexually mature.[11] Macaque groups tend to contain adults of both sexes. In addition, a Japanese macaque troop contains several matrilines. These matrilines may exist in a dominance hierarchy with all members of a specific group ranking over members of a lower-ranking group.[12] Temporary all-male groups also exist, composed of those who have recently left their natal groups and are about to transfer to another group.[5] However, many males spend ample time away from any group,[13] and may leave and join several groups.[5]

            Females of the troop exist in a stable dominance hierarchy and a female's rank depends on that of her mother. Younger females tend to rank higher than their older siblings.[12][14] Higher-ranking matrilines have greater social cohesion.[15] Strong relationships with dominant females can allow dominant males to retain their rank when they otherwise would not.[10] Males within a group normally[16] have a dominance hierarchy, with one male having alpha status. The dominance status of male macaques usually changes when a former alpha male leaves or dies.[17] Other ways in which status of male hierarchy changes, is when an alpha male loses his rank or when a troop splits, leaving a new alpha male position open.[17] The longer a male is in a troop, the higher his status is likely to be.[18]

            Females typically maintain both social relationships and hygiene through grooming. Grooming occurs regardless of climate or season.[19] Females who are matrilineally related groom each other more often than unrelated individuals.[20] Females will groom unrelated females to maintain group cohesion and social relationships between different kinships in a troop.[21] Nevertheless, a female will only groom a limited number of other females, even if the group expands.[21] Females will groom males, usually for hygienic purposes, but that behavior also may serve to attract dominant males to the group.[22] Mothers pass their grooming techniques to their offspring, most probably through social rather than genetic means,[23] as a cultural characteristic.

            Documented female troop leadership
            Yakei is a female who rose to leadership of her troop at Takasakiyama Natural Zoological Garden in 2021. Her troop consists of 677 Japanese macaque monkeys who live in a sanctuary that was established in 1952 at the zoological garden. At age nine, she overthrew the dominant males in her troop and displaced her high-ranking mother as well. She became the first female leader of the troop during its recorded history of seventy years.[24] Yakei has retained her leadership position through her first breeding season that had been thought to be a time when she might have been challenged successfully.[25] Both scientific and popular interest is leading to extensive coverage of Yakei's behavior.

            Mating and parenting

            Macaques mating
            A male and female macaque form a pair bond and mate, feed, rest, and travel together during the mating season, and on average, this relationship typically lasts 16 days.[26] Females enter into consortships with an average of four males a season.[27] Higher-ranking males have longer consortships than their subordinates.[26] In addition, higher-ranking males try to disrupt consortships of lower-ranking males.[28] Females may choose to mate with males of any rank. However, dominant males mate more frequently than others, as they are more successful in mate guarding.[29] The female decides whether mating takes place. In addition, a dominant position does not mean a male will successfully mate with a female.[5] Males may join other troops temporarily during the mating season and mate with those females.[30]

            During the mating season, the face and genitalia of males redden and their tails stand erect,[31] and the faces and anogenital regions of females turn scarlet.[31] Macaques copulate both on the ground and in the trees.[32] Roughly one in three copulations leads to ejaculation.[33] Macaques signal when they are ready to mate by looking backward over a shoulder, staying still, or walking backward toward their potential partner.[34] A female emits a "squawk", a "squeak", or produces an atonal "cackle" during copulation. Males have no copulatory vocalizations.

            Females engage in same-sex mounting unrelated to the mating season and therefore, are mounted more often by other females than by males.[35] This behavior has led to proposals in literature that female Japanese macaques are generally bisexual, rather than preferentially homo- or heterosexual.[36]

            A macaque mother moves to the periphery of her troop to give birth in a secluded spot,[37] unless the group is moving, when the female must stay with it.[38] Macaques usually give birth on the ground.[5] Infants are born with dark-brown hair.[39] A mother and her infant tend to avoid other troop members. The infants consume their first solid food at five to six weeks old, and by seven weeks, can forage independently from their mothers.[39] A mother carries her infant on her belly for its first four weeks. After this time, the mother carries her infant on her back, as well. Infants continue to be carried past a year.[39] The mother may socialize again very slowly.[40] However, alloparenting has been observed, usually by females who have not had infants of their own.[39] Male care of infants occurs in some groups, but not in others; when they do, usually, older males protect, groom, and carry an infant as a female would.[41]

            Infants have fully developed their locomotive abilities within three to four months.[42] When an infant is seven months old, its mother discourages suckling; full weaning happens by its eighteenth month.

            In some populations, male infants tend to play in larger groups more often than females.[43] However, female infants have more social interaction than their male counterparts,[43] and female infants will associate with individuals of all ages and sexes. When males are two years old, they prefer to associate with other males around the same age.[44]

            Communication
            During feeding or moving, Japanese macaques often emit sounds that are called "coos". These vocalizations most likely serve to keep the troop together and strengthen social relations among females.[45] Macaques usually respond to coos with coos of their own.[46] Coos also are uttered before grooming along with vocalizations identified as "girney" calls. Variants of the "girney" calls are made in different contexts.[47] This call also serves as appeasement between individuals in aggressive encounters.[48] Macaques have alarm calls for alerting to danger and other calls to signal estrus that sound similar to danger alerts. Threat calls are heard during aggressive encounters and are often uttered by supporters of those involved in antagonistic interactions. The individual being supported supports those callers in the future.[49]

            Intelligence and culture

            The famous Japanese warrior Kato Kiyomasa was depicted with his macaque who holds a writing brush, by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (1883)
            The Japanese macaque is an intelligent species. Researchers studying this species at Koshima Island in Japan left sweet potatoes out on the beach for them to eat, then witnessed one female, named Imo (Japanese for yam or potato), washing the food off with river water rather than brushing it off as the others were doing, and later even dipping her clean food into salty seawater.[50][51][52] After a while, other members of her troop started to copy her behavior. This trait was then passed on from generation to generation, until eventually all except the oldest members of the troop were washing their food and even seasoning it in the sea.[50][51] Similarly, she was the first observed balling up wheat with air pockets and soil, throwing it all into the water, and waiting for the wheat to float back up free from the soil to consume it.[51][52] An altered misaccount of this incident is the basis for the "hundredth monkey" effect.[53] That behavior also spread among her troop members.

            The macaque has other unusual behaviours, including bathing together in hot springs and rolling snowballs for fun.[51] In winter, the bathing is associated with lower levels of stress, with the higher ranking females dominating the restricted resource to compensate for the higher rates of stress outside of the spring.[54] Also, in recent studies, the Japanese macaque has been found to develop different accents, similar to human cultures.[55] Macaques in areas separated by only a few hundred miles may have very different pitches in their calls, their form of communication. The Japanese macaque has been involved in many studies concerning neuroscience and also is used in drug testing.[56][57][58]

            Ecology
            The Japanese macaque is diurnal. In colder areas, from autumn to early winter, macaques feed in between different activities. In the winter, macaques have two to four feeding bouts each day, with fewer daily activities. In the spring and summer, they have two or three bouts of feeding daily.[32] In warmer areas such as Yakushima, daily activities are more varied. The typical day for a macaque is 20.9% inactive, 22.8% traveling, 23.5% feeding, 27.9% social grooming, 1.2% self-grooming, and 3.7% other activities.[59] Macaques usually sleep in trees, but they also sleep on the ground, as well as on or near rocks and fallen trees.[5] During the winter, macaques huddle together for warmth on sleeping grounds.[60] Macaques at Jigokudani Monkey Park are notable for visiting the hot springs in the winter to warm up after being encouraged to concentrate there in the 1960s, part of a plan to reduce local crop damage from foraging.[61]

            Diet
            The Japanese macaque is omnivorous and eats a variety of foods. More than 213 species of plants are included in the macaque's diet.[62] They also eat insects, bark, and soil, as well as flowers and some nectar.[62][50] On Yakushima Island, fruit, mature leaves, and fallen seeds are primarily eaten.[63] The macaque also eats fungi, ferns, invertebrates, and other parts of plants.[63] In addition, in Yakushima, their diets vary seasonally with fruits being eaten in the summer and herbs being eaten in the winter.[64] Farther north, macaques mostly eat seasonal foods such as fruit and nuts to store fat for the winter, when food is scarce.[65] On the northern island of Kinkasan, macaques mostly eat fallen seeds, herbs, young leaves, and fruits, especially of the Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii) and Japanese zelkova (Zelkova serrata).[50][66] When preferred food items are not available, macaques dig up underground plant parts (roots or rhizomes) or eat soil and fish.[62][67]

            Distribution and habitat
            The Japanese macaque is the northernmost-living non-human primate. It is found on three of the four main Japanese islands, south of the Blakiston's Line: Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu.[5] The northernmost populations live on the Shimokita Peninsula, the northernmost point of Honshu.[68] Several of Japan's smaller islands are inhabited by macaques as well.[5] The southernmost population living on Yakushima Island is a subspecies of the mainland macaques, M. fuscata yakui.[68] A study in 1989 estimated the total population of wild Japanese macaques to be 114,431 individuals.[5][69]

            The Japanese macaque lives in a variety of habitats. It inhabits subtropical forests in the southern part of its range and subarctic forests in mountainous areas in the northern part of its range. It can be found in both warm and cool forests, such as the deciduous forests of central and northern Japan and the broadleaf evergreen forests in the southwest of the islands.[68] Warm temperate evergreen and broadleaf forests and cool temperate deciduous broadleaf forests are the most important habitats for macaques.[5]

            In 1972, a troop of approximately 150 Japanese macaques were relocated from Kyoto to a primate observatory in southwest Texas, United States. The observatory is an enclosed ranch-style environment and the macaques have been allowed to roam with minimal human interference. At first, many perished in the unfamiliar habitat, which consists of arid brushland. The macaques eventually adapted to the environment, learned to avoid predators (such as eagles, coyotes, and rattlesnakes), and they learned to forage for mesquite beans, cactus fruits, and other foods. The surviving macaques flourished, and by 1995, the troop consisted of 500 to 600 individuals. In 1996, hunters maimed or killed four escaped macaques; as a result, legal restrictions were publicly clarified and funds were raised to establish a new 186-acre (75 ha) sanctuary near Dilley, Texas.[70][71] In 1999, the Animal Protection Institute took over management of the sanctuary and began to rescue other species of primates. As of 2017, the troop cohabitated with six other species of macaque.[72]

            Relationship with humans

            Traditional human behaviors that are threats to macaques have been slash-and-burn agriculture, use of forest woods for construction and fuel, and hunting. Since World War II, these threats have declined due to social and economic changes in Japan,[73] including the prohibition of macaque hunting in 1947.[74] New threats have emerged, in particular the replacement of natural forests with lumber plantations.[73]

            Protection for the macaques, increased afforestation, and the human-caused extinction of their natural predators the Japanese wolf, have led to the macaque population growing heavily since the 1940s. Because of this, and land-use changes increasing the proximity of agriculture to the macaques' range,[75] they have become a major agricultural pest; they can climb over regular fences and quickly realise that deterrents such as scarecrows do not pose an actual threat, so methods such as electric fences must be used.[76][77] In 2019, the cost of agricultural damage caused by macaques was around 900 million yen.[78] Over 20,000 macaques are culled each year in an attempt to reduce agricultural damage, and there are concerns that this culling is reducing the macaques' range.[75]

            Macaques have often entered urban areas, with one macaque recorded living in central Tokyo for several months.[11] In 2022 the city of Yamaguchi experienced aggression from the monkeys with at least 50 people attacked.[79][80]

            <p>The mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx) is a large Old World monkey native to west central Africa. It is one of the most colorful mammals in the world, with red and blue skin on its face and posterior. The species is sexually dimorphic, as males have a larger body, longer canine teeth and brighter coloring. Its closest living relative is the drill, with which it shares the genus Mandrillus. Both species were traditionally thought to be baboons, but further evidence has shown that they are more closely related to white-eyelid mangabeys.

            Mandrills mainly live in tropical rainforests but will also travel across savannas. They are active during the day and spend most of their time on the ground. Their preferred foods are fruit and seeds, but mandrills will consume leaves, piths, mushrooms, and animals from insects to juvenile bay duiker. Mandrills live in large, stable groups known as "hordes" which can number in the hundreds. Females form the core of these groups, while adult males are solitary and only reunite with the larger groups during the breeding season. Dominant males have the most vibrant colors and fattest flanks and rumps, and have the most success siring young.

            The mandrill is classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Its biggest threats are habitat destruction and hunting for bushmeat. Gabon is considered the stronghold for the species. Its habitat has declined in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, while its range in the Republic of the Congo is limited.

            Etymology
            The word mandrill is derived from the English words man and drill—the latter meaning 'baboon' or 'ape' and being West African in origin—and dated to 1744.[3][4][5] The name appears to have originally referred to chimpanzees.[6] The first scholar to record the name for the colorful monkey was Georges-Louis Buffon in 1766. It was called the "tufted ape", "great baboon" and "ribbernosed baboon" by Thomas Pennant in A Synopsis of Quadrupeds (1771) and A History of Quadrupeds (1781).[7]

            Taxonomy
            The mandrill was first scientifically depicted in Historia animalium (1551–1558) by Conrad Gessner, who considered it a kind of hyena.[8] The species was formally classified by Carl Linnaeus as Simia sphinx in 1758. Its current generic name Mandrillus was coined by Ferdinand Ritgen in 1824.[9]

            Historically, some scientists placed the mandrill and the closely related drill (M. leucophaeus) in the baboon genus Papio. Morphological and genetic studies in the late 20th and early 21st centuries found a closer relationship to white-eyelid mangabeys of the genus Cercocebus. Some have even proposed that the mandrill and drill belong to Cercocebus.[10] Two genetic studies in 2011 clarified Mandrillus and Cercocebus as separate sister lineages.[11][12] The two genera split around 4.5 million years ago (mya) while the mandrill and drill split approximately 3.17 mya. Fossils of Mandrillus have not been found.[13]

            Some authorities have divided mandrill populations into subspecies: the northern mandrill (M. s. sphinx) and the southern mandrill (M. s. madarogaster). A proposed third subspecies, M. s. insularis, was based on the mistaken belief that mandrills are present on Bioko Island.[14][15] The consensus is that mandrills belong to one subspecies (M. s. sphinx).[16]

            Cytochrome-b sequences suggest that mandrill populations north and south of the Ogooué River split 800,000 years ago and belong to distinct haplogroups. This divergence appears to have also led to the splitting of the mandrill strain of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV).[17] The draft (incomplete) genome of the mandrill was published in 2020, with a reported genome size of 2.90 giga–base-pairs and high levels of heterozygosity.[18]

            Skull of male mandrill, showing the long canines and ridged bone swellings
            The mandrill has a stocky body with a large head and muzzle, as well as a short and stumpy tail.[19] The limbs are evenly sized and the fingers and toes are more elongated than those in baboons,[20] with a more opposable big toe on the feet.[21] The mandrill is the most sexually dimorphic primate,[22] and it is the largest monkey.[23] Females are less stocky and have shorter, flatter snouts.[19] Males have a 70–95 cm (28–37 in) head-body length and weigh 19–30 kg (42–66 lb) while females have a 55–70 cm (22–28 in) head-body length and weigh 10–15 kg (22–33 lb).[24] Most of the teeth are larger in males,[25] and the canine teeth reach up to 4.5 cm (1.8 in) and 1 cm (0.39 in) long for males and females respectively.[22] Both sexes have 7–10 cm (2.8–3.9 in) long tails.[24]

            Male and female mandrills, showing size and color dimorphism
            The coat of the mandrill is primarily grizzled or banded olive-brown with a yellow-orange beard and sparse, light hairs on its underside.[19][24] The lips are surrounded by stiff white whiskers, and white bare skin exists behind the ears. Male mandrills have a "crest" of long hairs on the head and neck, while both sexes have chest glands which are covered by long hairs. The face, rump and genitals have less hair.[26] The mandrill has a red line running down the middle of their face which connects to their red nose. On either side of the line, the skin is blue and grooved.[24][27] In males, the blue skin is supported by ridged bone swellings. Females have more subdued facial coloring, but this can vary between individuals with some having stronger red and blue hues and others being darker or almost black.[28] In males, the rump and areas around the genitals are multi-colored, consisting of red, pink, blue and purple skin,[20][28] with a red penis shaft and violet scrotum. The genital and anal areas of the female are red.[29]

            The mandrill is among the most colorful mammals. Charles Darwin wrote in The Descent of Man: "no other member of the whole class of mammals is coloured in so extraordinary a manner as the adult male mandrill".[30] The red coloration is created by blood vessels near the surface of the skin,[31] while the blue is a form of structural coloration caused by parallel arrangements of collagen fibers.[32] The blue ridges on males contrast with both the red facial hues and the green foliage of their environment, helping them stand out to other individuals.[33] The darker and more subdued coloring of female faces is caused by melanin.[34]

            The mandrill lives in west-central Africa, including southern Cameroon, mainland Equatorial Guinea (Río Muni), Gabon and parts of the Republic of the Congo. Its range is bounded by the Sanaga River to the north and the Ogooué and Ivindo Rivers to the east. It does not appear to share habitat with the drill, as the two species are separated by the Sanaga River.[35] Mandrills live in tropical rainforests, generally preferring primary forests over secondary forests. They also live in patchy gallery forests surrounded by savanna and travel across grass areas within their forest habitats.[36] They have also been recorded in mountainous areas, near rivers and in cultivated fields.[37]

            Mandrills prefer thick bush dominated by perennial plants like gingers and plants of the genera Brillantaisia and Phaulopsis.[24][37] They mainly dwell on the ground, but feed as high as the canopy.[36] Both mandrills and drills are more arboreal than baboons.[20] Mandrills may aggregate or compete with other primates such as talapoins, guenons, mangabeys, black-and-white colobuses, chimpanzees, and gorillas.[36][37]

The core of its diet consists of plants, of which it eats over a hundred species.[38] In Lopé National Park, the mandrill's diet was composed of fruit (50.7%), seeds (26.0%), leaves (8.2%), pith (6.8%), flowers (2.7%), and animal matter (4.1%), with other foods making up the remaining 1.4%.[39] During the wet season, mandrills forage in continuous forest, when fruit is most available, while during the dry season they feed in gallery forests and at the borders of savannas and forests.[40] The mandrill's preferred fruits include those of the cashew species Pseudospondias microcarpa, the coffee species Nauclea diderrichii and the wort species Psorospermum febrifugum.[40] Mandrills consume more seeds than many other primate species.[38] Adult male mandrills are one of the few primates capable of biting through the hard shell of Detarium microcarpum seeds.[39] For vegetation, they mostly eat the young leaves, shoots and piths of monocot plants.[38] In particular, mandrills consume leaves from the arrowroots Haumania liebrechtsiana and Trachyphrynium braunianum, as well as the piths of ginger plants like Renealmia macrocolia and species in the genus Aframomum.[40] They are also known to consume mushrooms.[38]

            The rest of a mandrill's diet is largely made up of invertebrates, particularly ants, termites, crickets, spiders, snails, and scorpions. They also eat birds and their eggs, frogs and rodents.[38][41] Mandrills have been recorded preying on larger vertebrates such as juvenile bay duikers. Such prey is killed with a bite to the head followed by pulling off the hind limbs and tearing open the belly. Individuals may cooperate during hunting and share kills.[41]

            Predators, parasites and pathogens
            Leopards may prey on mandrills, as traces of mandrill have been found in their feces.[42] Other potential predators include African rock pythons, crowned eagles and chimpanzees.[36][43] Leopards are a threat to all individuals, while eagles are only threats to the young.[44][43] In a study where a mandrill group was exposed to models of leopards and crown eagles, the leopard models tended to cause the mandrills to flee up trees while the eagles were more likely to drive them to take cover. The dominant male did not flee from either model types; in the case of the leopards, he paced around while looking in their direction. Alarm calls were more commonly heard in response to leopards than eagles.[44]

            Mandrills can become infected with gastrointestinal parasites, such as nematodes and protozoa. Tumbu fly larvae may live under the skin and individuals that walk though grassland can get infested with ticks. Blood parasites include the malaria-causing Plasmodium and the nematode Loa loa, which is transmitted by bites from deer flies.[45] Wild mandrills have tested positive for SIV, enteroviruses of the species EV-J and astroviruses, including a human variant.[17][46]

            Mandrills are mostly diurnal and are awake around 10 hours per day from morning to dusk.[38][47] They often pick a new tree to sleep in every night.[38] Mandrills have been observed using tools; in captivity, they use sticks to clean themselves.[48] In the wild, mandrills appear to live 12–14 years, but captive individuals can live 30–40 years.[49]

            Social structure
            Mandrills live in large "supergroups" or "hordes" that can contain hundreds of individuals.[40][50][51] These large groups are fairly stable and do not appear to be gatherings of smaller ones. At Lopé National Park, Gabon, mandrill hordes were found to have an average of 620 individuals, and some groups were as large as 845, making them possibly the largest cohesive groups of wild primates.[51] Another study in Lopé found that a horde of 625 mandrills consisted of 21 dominant males, 71 less dominant and subadult males, 247 adult and adolescent females, 200 juveniles, and 86 dependent infants.[40] A mandrill horde of around 700 individuals in northern Lopé had a total home range of 182 km2 (70 sq mi), 89 km2 (34 sq mi) of which was suitable habitat. The supergroup would occasionally diverge into two to four subgroups before reuniting.[52] Another 15-month long study of a 120-member group found a home range of 8.6 km2 (3.3 sq mi) with an average traveling distance of 2.42 km (1.50 mi) per day.[47]

            Hordes consist of matrilineal family groups, and females are important for maintaining social cohesion. Strong connections with their relatives may lead to support during conflicts, higher survival rate of offspring and a longer lifespan for females. Dominant females are at the center of the group network and their removal leads to fewer social connections in the group.[53] The social rank of a mother mandrill can contribute to the social rank of both her female and male offspring.[54] Mature males are not permanent members of hordes but join as females become sexually receptive and leave as their sexual cycle ends. As a result, the coloration of the male mandrill may be intended to attract attention in a social structure with no long-term relationships between mates.[51] Higher ranking males are found in the center of a social group while lower ranking males are more likely to occupy the periphery.[55] Females have some control over the males and coalitions can expel an unwanted male from a group.[56] Outside the breeding season, males are believed to lead a solitary life and all-male bachelor groups are not known to exist.[51]

            Both male and female mandrills rub and mark trees and branches with secretions from their chest glands, though males (and especially dominant males) mark more than females. The chemicals in the secretions signal the individual's sex, age and rank. Scent-marking may also serve a territorial function, captive alpha males will mark enclosure boundaries.[57] Mandrills will groom one another, even when there is no benefit to be gained from doing so.[58] During grooming, subordinates prefer to pick at other mandrills from behind, in order to minimize eye contact and give them more time to flee if the more dominant individual attacks. The recipients of grooming will try to maneuver the groomer to pick at more "risky" areas.[59]

            Reproduction and development

            Dominant or alpha male mandrills have the most mating success. Upon gaining alpha status, males develop larger testicles, redder faces and posteriors, more secretion from the chest glands and fatter sides and rumps. When a male loses dominance, these physiological changes are at least partially reversed.[31] The blue facial skin is more consistent in brightness.[31][60] Higher ranking males tend to have more contrast between red and blue facial coloring.[33] Due to their distribution of fat, dominant males are also known as "fatted" males while subordinate males are known as "non-fatted" males.[61] Canine length also correlates with dominance, and males are less likely to sire offspring when their canines are under 30 mm (1.2 in).[22] In some individuals, the development of secondary sexual characteristics is suppressed in response to competition from other males.[55] Male mandrills tend to establish dominance with vocalizations and facial expressions, rather than fighting.[62]

            Mating occurs mostly during the dry season, with female ovulation peaking between June and September. Receptive females have sexual swellings on their posteriors,[63] and the red facial coloration can communicate age and fertility.[64] Males also appear to detect a female's reproductive state using the vomeronasal organ (known as the flehmen response).[65] Dominant males try to monopolize access to females by mate guarding, which involves the male tending to and copulating with a female for days.[66] Dominant males tend to sire most of the offspring, but they are less able to monopolize access to the females when many females reach estrus at the same time. A subordinate male is also more likely to have reproductive success if he is closely related to an alpha male.[67] An ovulating female tends to allow the brightest colored males to come near her and touch her perineum, and is more likely to groom and solicit them.[68] The female signals her willingness to mate by positioning her posterior towards the male. Intercourse lasts no more than 60 seconds, with the male mounting the female and making pelvic thrusts.[69]

            Mandrill gestation lasts an average of 175 days with most births taking place between January and March, during the wet season. Gaps in between births range from 184 to 1,159 days with an average of 405 days.[70] and tend to be shorter in higher ranking females.[71] Infants are born at an average weight of 640 g (23 oz), and mostly bare-skinned with some white hair and a tuft of dark hair on the head and along the spine. Over the next two or three months, they develop their adult hair color on the body, limbs and head while the flesh-colored face and snout darken.[72] Dependent infants are carried on their mothers' bellies.[73][51] Young are typically weaned at around 230 days old. Males become more sexually dimorphic between four and eight years old, at which point females are already beginning to give birth.[54] Males start leaving their horde after they reach six years old.[51] Females reach their adult size around seven years while males do so at ten years.[54]

            Female mandrill facepalming
            Mandrills communicate with various facial expressions and postures. Threat displays involve open mouth staring, usually in combination with head bobbing, ground slapping and raised hair. These gestures are usually performed by dominant individuals towards subordinates, who respond with bared teeth grimaces, signaling fear and aggression. Both young and low-ranking females show submission and anxiety with a pouting "duck face". Playful intentions are communicated with a relaxed open-mouth face. Males approaching females display a "grin" or silent bared-teeth face and make lip-smacks. This display may also occur with teeth-chattering.[74] Mandrills can develop and pass on new gestures; captive individuals at the Colchester Zoo, England facepalm to discourage being disturbed, particularly while resting.[75]

            Mandrills also produce several vocalizations, for both long and short distances. During group movements, adult males produce two-phase grunts and one-syllable roars, both of which are equivalent to the "wahoo" bark of baboons. Other group members produce "crowings", which last almost two seconds and start as a vibration and transition into a longer harmonic sound. Short distance vocals include the "yak", a sharp, repeating, pulse-like call produced by all individuals except for adult males and made in tense situations. Mandrills may also grunt during aggressive encounters. Growls are used to express mild alarm while intense alarms come in the form of a short, two-syllable sharp call known as the "k-alarm". A sharp, loud "K-sound" is produced for unknown reasons. Screaming is a signal of fear and made by individuals fleeing, while the girney, a type of moan or purr, is made as a form of appeasement or frustration among females and young.[76][77] Individual voices are more similar among related animals, but unrelated mandrills can have similar voices if they regularly interact.[78]

            Threats and conservation
            As of 2019, the IUCN Red List lists the mandrill as vulnerable. Its total population is unknown but is suspected to have decreased by more than 30 percent over the last 24 years. Its main threats are habitat destruction and hunting for bushmeat.[1] The mandrill appears to have suffered massive habitat loss in Equatorial Guinea and southern Cameroon, while its range in the Republic of the Congo is limited and its status is unknown.[79] In addition, while mandrills live in groups numbering in the hundreds, hunting in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea appears to have led to smaller group sizes.[1] Gabon is seen as the most important remaining refuge for the species, and the country's low population density and vast rainforests make it a good candidate for mandrill conservation. Surveys have shown high population numbers for other primate species like chimpanzees and gorillas. A semi-wild population exists at the International Centre of Medical Research of Franceville.[80]

            The mandrill is listed under Appendix I by CITES, banning commercial trade in wild-caught specimens, and under Class B by the African Convention, which provides them protection but allows special authorization for their killing, capturing or collecting.[1][81][82] There is at least one protected area for mandrills within each of the countries they inhabit.[1] In Gabon, most of the rainforests have been leased to timber companies but around 10 percent is part of a national parks system, 13 of which were established in 2002.[83]

            <p>The chimpanzee (/tʃɪmpænˈzi/; Pan troglodytes), also simply known as the chimp, is a species of great ape native to the forests and savannahs of tropical Africa. It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed one. When its close relative, the bonobo, was more commonly known as the pygmy chimpanzee, this species was often called the common chimpanzee or the robust chimpanzee. The chimpanzee and the bonobo are the only species in the genus Pan. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that Pan is a sister taxon to the human lineage and is thus humans' closest living relative.

            The chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair but has a bare face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. It is larger and more robust than the bonobo, weighing 40–70 kg (88–154 lb) for males and 27–50 kg (60–110 lb) for females and standing 150 cm (4 ft 11 in).

            The chimpanzee lives in groups that range in size from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. The species lives in a strict male-dominated hierarchy, where disputes are generally settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools, modifying sticks, rocks, grass and leaves and using them for hunting and acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear small mammals. Its gestation period is eight months. The infant is weaned at about three years old but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several years more.

            The chimpanzee is listed on the IUCN Red List as an endangered species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range. The biggest threats to the chimpanzee are habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Chimpanzees appear in Western popular culture as stereotyped clown-figures and have featured in entertainments such as chimpanzees' tea parties, circus acts and stage shows. Although chimpanzees have been kept as pets, their strength, aggressiveness, and unpredictability makes them dangerous in this role. Some hundreds have been kept in laboratories for research, especially in the United States. Many attempts have been made to teach languages such as American Sign Language to chimpanzees, with limited success.

            The English word chimpanzee is first recorded in 1738.[6] It is derived from Vili ci-mpenze[7] or Tshiluba language chimpenze, with a meaning of "ape",[8] or "mockman".[9] The colloquialism "chimp" was most likely coined some time in the late 1870s.[10] The genus name Pan derives from the Greek god, while the specific name troglodytes was taken from the Troglodytae, a mythical race of cave-dwellers.[11][12]

            Taxonomy
            The first great ape known to Western science in the 17th century was the "orang-outang" (genus Pongo), the local Malay name being recorded in Java by the Dutch physician Jacobus Bontius. In 1641, the Dutch anatomist Nicolaes Tulp applied the name to a chimpanzee or bonobo brought to the Netherlands from Angola.[13] Another Dutch anatomist, Peter Camper, dissected specimens from Central Africa and Southeast Asia in the 1770s, noting the differences between the African and Asian apes. The German naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach classified the chimpanzee as Simia troglodytes by 1775. Another German naturalist, Lorenz Oken, coined the genus Pan in 1816. The bonobo was recognised as distinct from the chimpanzee by 1933.[11][12][14]

            Evolution
            Further information: Chimpanzee–human last common ancestor
            Despite a large number of Homo fossil finds, Pan fossils were not described until 2005. Existing chimpanzee populations in West and Central Africa do not overlap with the major human fossil sites in East Africa, but chimpanzee fossils have now been reported from Kenya. This indicates that both humans and members of the Pan clade were present in the East African Rift Valley during the Middle Pleistocene.[15][16][17]

            According to studies published in 2017 by researchers at George Washington University, bonobos, along with chimpanzees, split from the human line about 8 million years ago; then bonobos split from the common chimpanzee line about 2 million years ago.[18][19] Another 2017 genetic study suggests ancient gene flow (introgression) between 200,000 and 550,000 years ago from the bonobo into the ancestors of central and eastern chimpanzees.[20]

            Subspecies and population status
            Four subspecies of the chimpanzee have been recognised,[21][22] with the possibility of a fifth:[20][23]

            Central chimpanzee or the tschego (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), found in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with about 140,000 individuals existing in the wild.[24]
            Western chimpanzee (P. troglodytes verus), found in Ivory Coast, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, and Ghana with about 52,800 individuals still in existence.[25][26]
            Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee (P. troglodytes ellioti (also known as P. t. vellerosus)),[21] that live within forested areas across Nigeria and Cameroon, with 6000–9000 individuals still in existence.[27][28]
            Eastern chimpanzee (P. troglodytes schweinfurthii), found in the Central African Republic, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, and Zambia, with approximately 180,000–256,000 individuals still existing in the wild.[29]
            Southeastern chimpanzee, P. troglodytes marungensis, in Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. Colin Groves argues that this is a subspecies, created by enough variation between the northern and southern populations of P. t. schweinfurthii,[23] but it is not recognised by the IUCN.[2]

            Genome size	3,323.27 Mb
            Number of chromosomes	24 pairs
            A draft version of the chimpanzee genome was published in 2005 and encodes 18,759 proteins,[30][31] (compared to 20,383 in the human proteome).[32] The DNA sequences of humans and chimpanzees are very similar and the difference in protein number mostly arises from incomplete sequences in the chimpanzee genome. Both species differ by about 35 million single-nucleotide changes, five million insertion/deletion events and various chromosomal rearrangements.[33] Typical human and chimpanzee protein homologs differ in an average of only two amino acids. About 30% of all human proteins are identical in sequence to the corresponding chimpanzee protein. Duplications of small parts of chromosomes have been the major source of differences between human and chimpanzee genetic material; about 2.7% of the corresponding modern genomes represent differences, produced by gene duplications or deletions[failed verification], since humans and chimpanzees diverged from their common evolutionary ancestor.[30][33]

            Characteristics

            Skeleton
            Adult chimpanzees have an average standing height of 150 cm (4 ft 11 in).[34] Wild adult males weigh between 40 and 70 kg (88 and 154 lb),[35][36][37] and females weigh between 27 and 50 kg (60 and 110 lb).[38] In exceptional cases, certain individuals may considerably exceed these measurements, standing over 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) on two legs and weighing up to 136 kg (300 lb) in captivity.[a]

            The chimpanzee is more robustly built than the bonobo but less than the gorilla. The arms of a chimpanzee are longer than its legs and can reach below the knees. The hands have long fingers with short thumbs and flat fingernails. The feet are adapted for grasping, and the big toe is opposable. The pelvis is long with an extended ilium. A chimpanzee's head is rounded with a prominent and prognathous face and a pronounced brow ridge. It has forward-facing eyes, a small nose, rounded non-lobed ears and a long mobile upper lip. Additionally, adult males have sharp canine teeth. Like all great apes, it has a dental formula of 
            2.1.2.3
            2.1.2.3
            , that is, two incisors, one canine, two premolars, and three molars on both halves of each jaw. Chimpanzees lack the prominent sagittal crest and associated head and neck musculature of gorillas.[14][41]


            Chimpanzee hand (left) compared to human hand
            Chimpanzee bodies are covered by coarse hair, except for the face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. Chimpanzees lose more hair as they age and develop bald spots. The hair of a chimpanzee is typically black but can be brown or ginger. As they get older, white or grey patches may appear, particularly on the chin and lower region.[14][41] Chimpanzee skin that is covered with body hair is white, while exposed areas vary: white which ages into a dark muddy colour in eastern chimpanzees, freckled on white which ages to a heavily mottled muddy colour in central chimpanzees, and black with a butterfly-shaped white mask that darkens with age in western chimpanzees.[42][43] Facial pigmentation increases with age and exposure to ultraviolet light. Females develop swelling pink skin when in oestrus.[14][41] Like bonobos, male chimpanzees have a long filiform penis with a small baculum, but without a glans.[44]

            Chimpanzees are adapted for both arboreal and terrestrial locomotion. Arboreal locomotion consists of vertical climbing and brachiation.[45][46] On the ground, chimpanzees move both quadrupedally and bipedally. These movements appear to have similar energy costs.[47] As with bonobos and gorillas, chimpanzees move quadrupedally by knuckle-walking, which probably evolved independently in Pan and Gorilla.[48] Their muscles are 50% stronger per weight than those of humans due to higher content of fast twitch muscle fibres, one of the chimpanzee's adaptations for climbing and swinging.[49] According to Japan's Asahiyama Zoo, the grip strength of an adult chimpanzee is estimated to be 200 kg (440 lb),[50] while other sources claim figures of up to 330 kg (730 lb).[b]

            Ecology

            The chimpanzee is a highly adaptable species. It lives in a variety of habitats, including dry savanna, evergreen rainforest, montane forest, swamp forest, and dry woodland-savanna mosaic.[53][54] In Gombe, the chimpanzee mostly uses semideciduous and evergreen forest as well as open woodland.[55] At Bossou, the chimpanzee inhabits multistage secondary deciduous forest, which has grown after shifting cultivation, as well as primary forest and grassland.[56] At Taï, it is found in the last remaining tropical rain forest in Ivory Coast.[57] The chimpanzee has an advanced cognitive map of its home range and can repeatedly find food.[58] The chimpanzee builds a sleeping nest in a tree in a different location each night, never using the same nest more than once. Chimpanzees sleep alone in separate nests except for infants or juvenile chimpanzees, which sleep with their mothers.[59]

            Diet

            The chimpanzee is an omnivorous frugivore. It prefers fruit above all other food, but it also eats leaves, leaf buds, seeds, blossoms, stems, pith, bark, and resin.[60][61] A study in Budongo Forest, Uganda found that 64.5% of their feeding time concentrated on fruits (84.6% of which being ripe), particularly those from two species of Ficus, Maesopsis eminii, and Celtis gomphophylla. In addition, 19% of feeding time was spent on arboreal leaves, mostly Broussonetia papyrifera and Celtis mildbraedii.[62] While the chimpanzee is mostly herbivorous, it does eat honey, soil, insects, birds and their eggs, and small to medium-sized mammals, including other primates.[60][63] Insect species consumed include the weaver ant Oecophylla longinoda, Macrotermes termites, and honey bees.[64][65] The red colobus ranks at the top of preferred mammal prey. Other mammalian prey include red-tailed monkeys, infant and juvenile yellow baboons, bush babies, blue duikers, bushbucks, and common warthogs.[66]

            Despite the fact that chimpanzees are known to hunt and to collect both insects and other invertebrates, such food actually makes up a very small portion of their diet, from as little as 2% yearly to as much as 65 grams of animal flesh per day for each adult chimpanzee in peak hunting seasons. This also varies from troop to troop and year to year. However, in all cases, the majority of their diet consists of fruits, leaves, roots, and other plant matter.[61][67] Female chimpanzees appear to consume much less animal flesh than males, according to several studies.[68] Jane Goodall documented many occasions within Gombe Stream National Park of chimpanzees and western red colobus monkeys ignoring each other despite close proximity.[59][69]

            Chimpanzees do not appear to directly compete with gorillas in areas where they overlap. When fruit is abundant, gorilla and chimpanzee diets converge, but when fruit is scarce gorillas resort to vegetation.[70] The two apes may also feed on different species, whether fruit or insects.[64][65][71] Interactions between them can range from friendly and even stable social bonding,[72] to avoidance,[70][73] to aggression and even predation of infants on the part of chimpanzees.[74]

            Mortality and health

            Chimpanzee named "Gregoire" on 9 December 2006, born in 1944 (Jane Goodall sanctuary of Tchimpounga, Republic of the Congo)
            The average lifespan of a wild chimpanzee is relatively short. They usually live less than 15 years, although individuals that reach 12 years may live an additional 15 years. On rare occasions, wild chimpanzees may live nearly 60 years. Captive chimpanzees tend to live longer than most wild ones, with median lifespans of 31.7 years for males and 38.7 years for females.[75] The oldest-known male captive chimpanzee to have been documented lived to 66 years,[76] and the oldest female, Little Mama, was nearly 80 years old.[77]

            Leopards prey on chimpanzees in some areas.[78][79] It is possible that much of the mortality caused by leopards can be attributed to individuals that have specialised in killing chimpanzees.[78] Chimpanzees may react to a leopard's presence with loud vocalising, branch shaking, and throwing objects.[78][80] There is at least one record of chimpanzees killing a leopard cub after mobbing it and its mother in their den.[81] Four chimpanzees could have fallen prey to lions at Mahale Mountains National Park. Although no other instances of lion predation on chimpanzees have been recorded, lions likely do kill chimpanzees occasionally, and the larger group sizes of savanna chimpanzees may have developed as a response to threats from these big cats. Chimpanzees may react to lions by fleeing up trees, vocalising, or hiding in silence.[82]


            The chimpanzee louse Pediculus schaeffi is closely related to the human body louse P. humanus.
            Chimpanzees and humans share only 50% of their parasite and microbe species. This is due to the differences in environmental and dietary adaptations; human internal parasite species overlap more with omnivorous, savanna-dwelling baboons. The chimpanzee is host to the louse species Pediculus schaeffi, a close relative of P. humanus, which infests human head and body hair. By contrast, the human pubic louse Pthirus pubis is closely related to Pthirus gorillae, which infests gorillas.[83] A 2017 study of gastrointestinal parasites of wild chimpanzees in degraded forest in Uganda found nine species of protozoa, five nematodes, one cestode, and one trematode. The most prevalent species was the protozoan Troglodytella abrassarti.[84]

            Behaviour
            Recent studies have suggested that human observers influence chimpanzee behaviour. One suggestion is that drones, camera traps, and remote microphones should be used to record and monitor chimpanzees rather than direct human observation.[85][failed verification]

            Group structure

            Group in Uganda
            Chimpanzees live in communities that typically range from around 15 to more than 150 members but spend most of their time traveling in small, temporary groups consisting of a few individuals. These groups may consist of any combination of age and sexes. Both males and females sometimes travel alone.[59] This fission–fusion society may include groups of four types: all-male, adult females and offspring, adults of both sexes, or one female and her offspring. These smaller groups emerge in a variety of types, for a variety of purposes. For example, an all-male troop may be organised to hunt for meat, while a group consisting of lactating females serves to act as a "nursery group" for the young.[86]

            At the core of social structures are males, which patrol the territory, protect group members, and search for food. Males remain in their natal communities, while females generally emigrate at adolescence. Males in a community are more likely to be related to one another than females are to each other. Among males, there is generally a dominance hierarchy, and males are dominant over females.[87] However, this unusual fission-fusion social structure, "in which portions of the parent group may on a regular basis separate from and then rejoin the rest,"[88] is highly variable in terms of which particular individual chimpanzees congregate at a given time. This is caused mainly by the large measure of individual autonomy that individuals have within their fission-fusion social groups.[41] As a result, individual chimpanzees often forage for food alone, or in smaller groups, as opposed to the much larger "parent" group, which encompasses all the chimpanzees which regularly come into contact with each other and congregate into parties in a particular area.[86]

            Male chimpanzees exist in a linear dominance hierarchy. Top-ranking males tend to be aggressive even during dominance stability.[89] This is probably due to the chimpanzee's fission-fusion society, with male chimpanzees leaving groups and returning after extended periods of time. With this, a dominant male is unsure if any "political maneuvering" has occurred in his absence and must re-establish his dominance. Thus, a large amount of aggression occurs within five to fifteen minutes after a reunion. During these encounters, displays of aggression are generally preferred over physical attacks.[89][90]

            Males maintain and improve their social ranks by forming coalitions, which have been characterised as "exploitative" and based on an individual's influence in agonistic interactions.[91] Being in a coalition allows males to dominate a third individual when they could not by themselves, as politically apt chimpanzees can exert power over aggressive interactions regardless of their rank. Coalitions can also give an individual male the confidence to challenge a dominant or larger male. The more allies a male has, the better his chance of becoming dominant. However, most changes in hierarchical rank are caused by dyadic interactions.[89][92] Chimpanzee alliances can be very fickle, and one member may suddenly turn on another if it is to his advantage.[93]


            Mutual grooming, removing lice
            Low-ranking males frequently switch sides in disputes between more dominant individuals. Low-ranking males benefit from an unstable hierarchy and often find increased sexual opportunities if a dispute or conflict occurs.[91][93] In addition, conflicts between dominant males cause them to focus on each other rather than the lower-ranking males. Social hierarchies among adult females tend to be weaker. Nevertheless, the status of an adult female may be important for her offspring.[94] Females in Taï have also been recorded to form alliances.[95] While chimpanzee social structure is often referred to as patriarchal, it is not entirely unheard of for females to forge coalitions against males.[96] There is also at least one recorded case of females securing a dominant position over males in their respective troop, albeit in a captive environment.[97] Social grooming appears to be important in the formation and maintenance of coalitions. It is more common among adult males than either between adult females or between males and females.[92]


            Males in Mahale National Park, Tanzania
            Chimpanzees have been described as highly territorial and will frequently kill other chimpanzees,[98] although Margaret Power wrote in her 1991 book The Egalitarians that the field studies from which the aggressive data came, Gombe and Mahale, used artificial feeding systems that increased aggression in the chimpanzee populations studied. Thus, the behaviour may not reflect innate characteristics of the species as a whole.[99] In the years following her artificial feeding conditions at Gombe, Jane Goodall described groups of male chimpanzees patrolling the borders of their territory, brutally attacking chimpanzees that had split off from the Gombe group. A study published in 2010 found that the chimpanzees wage wars over territory, not mates.[100] Patrols from smaller groups are more likely to avoid contact with their neighbours. Patrols from large groups even take over a smaller group's territory, gaining access to more resources, food, and females.[93][101] While it was traditionally accepted that only female chimpanzees immigrate and males remain in their natal troop for life, there are confirmed cases of adult males safely integrating themselves into new communities among West African chimpanzees, suggesting they are less territorial than other subspecies.[102]

            Mating and parenting

            Infant and mother
            Chimpanzees mate throughout the year, although the number of females in oestrus varies seasonally in a group.[103] Female chimpanzees are more likely to come into oestrus when food is readily available. Oestrous females exhibit sexual swellings. Chimpanzees are promiscuous: during oestrus, females mate with several males in their community, while males have large testicles for sperm competition. Other forms of mating also exist. A community's dominant males sometimes restrict reproductive access to females. A male and female can form a consortship and mate outside their community. In addition, females sometimes leave their community and mate with males from neighboring communities.[104][105] These alternative mating strategies give females more mating opportunities without losing the support of the males in their community.[105] Infanticide has been recorded in chimpanzee communities in some areas, and the victims are often consumed. Male chimpanzees practice infanticide on unrelated young to shorten the interbirth intervals in the females.[106][107] Females sometimes practice infanticide. This may be related to the dominance hierarchy in females or may simply be pathological.[94]

            Inbreeding was studied in a relatively undisturbed eastern chimpanzee community that displayed substantial bisexual philopatry.[108] Despite an increased inbreeding risk incurred by females who do not disperse before reaching reproductive age, these females were still able to avoid producing inbred offspring.[108]

            Copulation is brief, lasting approximately seven seconds.[109] The gestation period is eight months.[41] Care for the young is provided mostly by their mothers. The survival and emotional health of the young is dependent on maternal care. Mothers provide their young with food, warmth, and protection, and teach them certain skills. In addition, a chimpanzee's future rank may be dependent on its mother's status.[110][111] Male chimpanzees continue to associate with the females they impregnated and interact with and support their offspring.[112] Newborn chimpanzees are helpless. For example, their grasping reflex is not strong enough to support them for more than a few seconds. For their first 30 days, infants cling to their mother's bellies. Infants are unable to support their own weight for their first two months and need their mothers' support.[113]

            Wild chimps are seen to exhibit both "secure" and "insecure" attachment styles, with the offspring looking to the mother for comfort in the former and more independent offspring in the latter. However, wild chimps rarely demonstrate "disorganized" attachment styles (maladaptive parent-offspring bonds caused by abuse or neglect); researchers note such attachment styles are mostly observed in captive chimps raised in the human context[114]

            When they reach five to six months, infants ride on their mothers' backs. They remain in continual contact for the rest of their first year. When they reach two years of age, they are able to move and sit independently and start moving beyond the arms' reach of their mothers. By four to six years, chimpanzees are weaned and infancy ends. The juvenile period for chimpanzees lasts from their sixth to ninth years. Juveniles remain close to their mothers, but interact an increasing amount with other members of their community. Adolescent females move between groups and are supported by their mothers in agonistic encounters. Adolescent males spend time with adult males in social activities like hunting and boundary patrolling.[113] A captive study suggests males can safely immigrate to a new group if accompanied by immigrant females who have an existing relationship with this male. This gives the resident males reproductive advantages with these females, as they are more inclined to remain in the group if their male friend is also accepted.[115]

            Problems playing this file? See media help.
            Chimpanzees use facial expressions, postures, and sounds to communicate with each other. Chimpanzees have expressive faces that are important in close-up communications. When frightened, a "full closed grin" causes nearby individuals to be fearful, as well. Playful chimpanzees display an open-mouthed grin. Chimpanzees may also express themselves with the "pout", which is made in distress, the "sneer", which is made when threatening or fearful, and "compressed-lips face", which is a type of display. When submitting to a dominant individual, a chimpanzee crunches, bobs, and extends a hand. When in an aggressive mode, a chimpanzee swaggers bipedally, hunched over and arms waving, in an attempt to exaggerate its size.[117] While travelling, chimpanzees keep in contact by beating their hands and feet against the trunks of large trees, an act that is known as "drumming". They also do this when encountering individuals from other communities.[118]

            Vocalisations are also important in chimpanzee communication. The most common call in adults is the "pant-hoot", which may signal social rank and bond along with keeping groups together. Pant-hoots are made of four parts, starting with soft "hoos", the introduction; that gets louder and louder, the build-up; and climax into screams and sometimes barks; these die down back to soft "hoos" during the letdown phase as the call ends.[116][118] Grunting is made in situations like feeding and greeting.[118] Submissive individuals make "pant-grunts" towards their superiors.[94][119] Whimpering is made by young chimpanzees as a form of begging or when lost from the group.[118] Chimpanzees use distance calls to draw attention to danger, food sources, or other community members.[120] "Barks" may be made as "short barks" when hunting and "tonal barks" when sighting large snakes.[118]

            Hunting
            When hunting small monkeys such as the red colobus, chimpanzees hunt where the forest canopy is interrupted or irregular. This allows them to easily corner the monkeys when chasing them in the appropriate direction. Chimpanzees may also hunt as a coordinated team, so that they can corner their prey even in a continuous canopy. During an arboreal hunt, each chimpanzee in the hunting groups has a role. "Drivers" serve to keep the prey running in a certain direction and follow them without attempting to make a catch. "Blockers" are stationed at the bottom of the trees and climb up to block prey that takes off in a different direction. "Chasers" move quickly and try to make a catch. Finally, "ambushers" hide and rush out when a monkey nears.[121] While both adults and infants are taken, adult male colobus monkeys will attack the hunting chimps.[122] When caught and killed, the meal is distributed to all hunting party members and even bystanders.[121]

            Male chimpanzees hunt in groups more than females. Female chimpanzees tend to hunt solitarily. If a female chimpanzee were to participate in the hunting group and catch a Red Colobus, it would likely immediately be taken by an adult male. Female chimpanzees are estimated to hunt ≈ 10-15% of a community's vertebrates.[123]

            Intelligence

            Drawing of human and chimpanzee skull and brain
            Human and chimpanzee skull and brain. Diagram by Paul Gervais from Histoire naturelle des mammifères (1854).
            Chimpanzees display numerous signs of intelligence, from the ability to remember symbols[124] to cooperation,[125] tool use,[126] and varied language capabilities.[127] They are among species that have passed the mirror test, suggesting self-awareness.[128] In one study, two young chimpanzees showed retention of mirror self-recognition after one year without access to mirrors.[129] Chimpanzees have been observed to use insects to treat their own wounds and those of others. They catch them and apply them directly to the injury.[130] Chimpanzees also display signs of culture among groups, with the learning and transmission of variations in grooming, tool use and foraging techniques leading to localized traditions.[131]

            A 30-year study at Kyoto University's Primate Research Institute has shown that chimpanzees are able to learn to recognise the numbers 1 to 9 and their values. The chimpanzees further show an aptitude for eidetic memory, demonstrated in experiments in which the jumbled digits are flashed onto a computer screen for less than a quarter of a second. One chimpanzee, Ayumu, was able to correctly and quickly point to the positions where they appeared in ascending order. Ayumu performed better than human adults who were given the same test.[124]

            In controlled experiments on cooperation, chimpanzees show a basic understanding of cooperation, and recruit the best collaborators.[125] In a group setting with a device that delivered food rewards only to cooperating chimpanzees, cooperation first increased, then, due to competitive behaviour, decreased, before finally increasing to the highest level through punishment and other arbitrage behaviours.[132]

            Great apes show laughter-like vocalisations in response to physical contact, such as wrestling, play chasing, or tickling. This is documented in wild and captive chimpanzees. Chimpanzee laughter is not readily recognisable to humans as such, because it is generated by alternating inhalations and exhalations that sound more like breathing and panting. Instances in which nonhuman primates have expressed joy have been reported. Humans and chimpanzees share similar ticklish areas of the body, such as the armpits and belly. The enjoyment of tickling in chimpanzees does not diminish with age.[133]

            A 2022 study reported that chimpanzees crushed and applied insects to their own wounds and the wounds of other chimpanzees.[134] Chimpanzees have displayed different behaviours in response to a dying or dead group member. When witnessing a sudden death, the other group members act in frenzy, with vocalisations, aggressive displays, and touching of the corpse. In one case chimpanzees cared for a dying elder, then attended and cleaned the corpse. Afterward, they avoided the spot where the elder died and behaved in a more subdued manner.[135] Mothers have been reported to carry around and groom their dead infants for several days.[136]

            Experimenters now and then witness behaviour that cannot be readily reconciled with chimpanzee intelligence or theory of mind. Wolfgang Köhler, for instance, reported insightful behaviour in chimpanzees, but he likewise often observed that they experienced "special difficulty" in solving simple problems.[137] Researchers also reported that, when faced with a choice between two persons, chimpanzees were just as likely to beg food from a person who could see the begging gesture as from a person who could not, thereby raising the possibility that chimpanzees lack theory of mind.[138] By contrast, Hare, Call, and Tomasello found that subordinate chimpanzees were able to use the knowledge state of dominant rival chimpanzees to determine which container of hidden food they approached.[139]

            Tool use
            Further information: Tool use by animals
            Chimpanzees using twigs to dip for ants
            Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools. They modify sticks, rocks, grass, and leaves and use them when foraging for termites and ants,[140] nuts,[140][141][142][143] honey,[144] algae[145] or water. Despite the lack of complexity, forethought and skill are apparent in making these tools.[126] Chimpanzees have used stone tools since at least 4,300 years ago.[146]

            A chimpanzee from the Kasakela chimpanzee community was the first nonhuman animal reported making a tool, by modifying a twig to use as an instrument for extracting termites from their mound.[147][148] At Taï, chimpanzees simply use their hands to extract termites.[126] When foraging for honey, chimpanzees use modified short sticks to scoop the honey out of the hive if the bees are stingless. For hives of the dangerous African honeybees, chimpanzees use longer and thinner sticks to extract the honey.[149]

            Chimpanzees also fish for ants using the same tactic.[150] Ant dipping is difficult and some chimpanzees never master it. West African chimpanzees crack open hard nuts with stones or branches.[126][150] Some forethought in this activity is apparent, as these tools are not found together or where the nuts are collected. Nut cracking is also difficult and must be learned.[150] Chimpanzees also use leaves as sponges or spoons to drink water.[151]

            West African chimpanzees in Senegal were found to sharpen sticks with their teeth, which were then used to spear Senegal bushbabies out of small holes in trees.[152] An eastern chimpanzee has been observed using a modified branch as a tool to capture a squirrel.[153] Chimpanzees living in Tanzania were found to deliberately choose plants that provide materials that produce more flexible tools for termite fishing.[154]

            Whilst experimental studies on captive chimpanzees have found that many of their species-typical tool-use behaviours can be individually learnt by each chimpanzees,[155] a 2021 study on their abilities to make and use stone flakes, in a similar way as hypothesised for early hominins, did not find this behaviour across two populations of chimpanzees—suggesting that this behaviour is outside the chimpanzee species-typical range.[156]

            Language
            Main article: Great ape language

            Hugo Rheinhold's Affe mit Schädel ("Ape with skull"), c. 1893
            Scientists have attempted to teach human language to several species of great ape. One early attempt by Allen and Beatrix Gardner in the 1960s involved spending 51 months teaching American Sign Language to a chimpanzee named Washoe. The Gardners reported that Washoe learned 151 signs, and had spontaneously taught them to other chimpanzees, including her adopted son, Loulis.[157] Over a longer period of time, Washoe was reported to have learned over 350 signs.[158]

            Debate is ongoing among scientists such as David Premack about chimpanzees' ability to learn language. Since the early reports on Washoe, numerous other studies have been conducted, with varying levels of success.[127] One involved a chimpanzee jokingly named Nim Chimpsky (in allusion to the theorist of language Noam Chomsky), trained by Herbert Terrace of Columbia University. Although his initial reports were quite positive, in November 1979, Terrace and his team, including psycholinguist Thomas Bever, re-evaluated the videotapes of Nim with his trainers, analyzing them frame by frame for signs, as well as for exact context (what was happening both before and after Nim's signs). In the reanalysis, Terrace and Bever concluded that Nim's utterances could be explained merely as prompting on the part of the experimenters, as well as mistakes in reporting the data. "Much of the apes' behaviour is pure drill", he said. "Language still stands as an important definition of the human species." In this reversal, Terrace now argued Nim's use of ASL was not like human language acquisition. Nim never initiated conversations himself, rarely introduced new words, and mostly imitated what the humans did. More importantly, Nim's word strings varied in their ordering, suggesting that he was incapable of syntax. Nim's sentences also did not grow in length, unlike human children whose vocabulary and sentence length show a strong positive correlation.[159]

            Human relations
            In culture

            Chimpanzee mask, Gio tribe, Liberia
            Chimpanzees are rarely represented in African culture, as people find them "too close for comfort". The Gio people of Liberia and the Hemba people of the Congo make chimpanzee masks. Gio masks are crude and blocky, and worn when teaching young people how not to behave. The Hemba masks have a smile that suggests drunken anger, insanity or horror and are worn during rituals at funerals, representing the "awful reality of death". The masks may also serve to guard households and protect both human and plant fertility. Stories have been told of chimpanzees kidnapping and raping women.[160]

            In Western popular culture, chimpanzees have occasionally been stereotyped as childlike companions, sidekicks or clowns. They are especially suited for the latter role on account of their prominent facial features, long limbs and fast movements, which humans often find amusing. Accordingly, entertainment acts featuring chimpanzees dressed up as humans with lip-synchronised human voices have been traditional staples of circuses, stage shows and TV shows like Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp (1970–1972) and The Chimp Channel (1999).[161] From 1926 until 1972, London Zoo, followed by several other zoos around the world, held a chimpanzees' tea party daily, inspiring a long-running series of advertisements for PG Tips tea featuring such a party.[162][163] Animal rights groups have urged a stop to such acts, considering them abusive.[164]

            Chimpanzees in media include Judy on the television series Daktari in the 1960s and Darwin on The Wild Thornberrys in the 1990s. In contrast to the fictional depictions of other animals, such as dogs (as in Lassie), dolphins (Flipper), horses (Black Beauty) or even other great apes (King Kong), chimpanzee characters and actions are rarely relevant to the plot. Depictions of chimpanzees as individuals rather than stock characters, and as central rather than incidental to the plot can be found in science fiction. Robert A. Heinlein's 1947 short story "Jerry Was a Man" concerns a genetically enhanced chimpanzee suing for better treatment. The 1972 film Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, the third sequel of the 1968 film Planet of the Apes, portrays a futuristic revolt of enslaved apes led by the only talking chimpanzee, Caesar, against their human masters.[161]

            As pets
            Chimpanzees have traditionally been kept as pets in a few African villages, especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In Virunga National Park in the east of the country, the park authorities regularly seize chimpanzees from people keeping them as pets.[165] Outside their range, chimpanzees are popular as exotic pets despite their strength and aggression. Even in places where keeping non-human primates as pets is illegal, the exotic pet trade continues to prosper, leading to injuries from attacks.[166]

            Use in research
            See also: Countries banning non-human ape experimentation and Animal testing on non-human primates § Chimpanzees in the U.S.
            Hundreds of chimpanzees have been kept in laboratories for research. Most such laboratories either conduct or make the animals available for invasive research,[167] defined as "inoculation with an infectious agent, surgery or biopsy conducted for the sake of research and not for the sake of the chimpanzee, and/or drug testing".[168] Research chimpanzees tend to be used repeatedly over decades for up to 40 years, unlike the pattern of use of most laboratory animals.[169] Two federally funded American laboratories use chimpanzees: the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Southwest National Primate Center in San Antonio, Texas.[170] Five hundred chimpanzees have been retired from laboratory use in the US and live in animal sanctuaries in the US or Canada.[167]

            A five-year moratorium was imposed by the US National Institutes of Health in 1996, because too many chimpanzees had been bred for HIV research, and it has been extended annually since 2001.[170] With the publication of the chimpanzee genome, plans to increase the use of chimpanzees in America were reportedly increasing in 2006, some scientists arguing that the federal moratorium on breeding chimpanzees for research should be lifted.[170][171] However, in 2007, the NIH made the moratorium permanent.[172]

            Other researchers argue that chimpanzees either should not be used in research, or should be treated differently, for instance with legal status as persons.[173] Pascal Gagneux, an evolutionary biologist and primate expert at the University of California, San Diego, argues, given chimpanzees' sense of self, tool use, and genetic similarity to human beings, studies using chimpanzees should follow the ethical guidelines used for human subjects unable to give consent.[170] A recent study suggests chimpanzees which are retired from labs exhibit a form of post-traumatic stress disorder.[174] Stuart Zola, director of the Yerkes laboratory, disagrees. He told National Geographic: "I don't think we should make a distinction between our obligation to treat humanely any species, whether it's a rat or a monkey or a chimpanzee. No matter how much we may wish it, chimps are not human."[170]

            Only one European laboratory, the Biomedical Primate Research Centre in Rijswijk, the Netherlands, used chimpanzees in research. It formerly held 108 chimpanzees among 1,300 non-human primates. The Dutch ministry of science decided to phase out research at the centre from 2001.[175] Trials already under way were however allowed to run their course.[176] Chimpanzees including the female Ai have been studied at the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University, Japan, formerly directed by Tetsuro Matsuzawa, since 1978. 12 chimpanzees are currently[when?] held at the facility.[177]

            Two chimpanzees have been sent into outer space as NASA research subjects. Ham, the first great ape in space, was launched in the Mercury-Redstone 2 capsule on 31 January 1961, and survived the suborbital flight. Enos, the third primate to orbit Earth after Soviet cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin and Gherman Titov, flew on Mercury-Atlas 5 on 29 November of the same year.[178][179]

            Field study

            Feeding station at Gombe, where Jane Goodall used to feed and observe the chimpanzees
            Jane Goodall undertook the first long-term field study of the chimpanzee, begun in Tanzania at Gombe Stream National Park in 1960.[180] Other long-term studies begun in the 1960s include Adriaan Kortlandt's in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and Toshisada Nishida's in Mahale Mountains National Park in Tanzania.[181][182] Current understanding of the species' typical behaviours and social organisation has been formed largely from Goodall's ongoing 60-year Gombe research study.[99][183][184]

            Attacks
            Chimpanzees have attacked humans.[185][186] In Uganda, several attacks on children have happened, some of them fatal. Some of these attacks may have been due to the chimpanzees being intoxicated (from alcohol obtained from rural brewing operations) and becoming aggressive towards humans.[187] Human interactions with chimpanzees may be especially dangerous if the chimpanzees perceive humans as potential rivals.[188] At least six cases of chimpanzees snatching and eating human babies are documented.[189]

            A chimpanzee's strength and sharp teeth mean that attacks, even on adult humans, can cause severe injuries. This was evident after the attack and near death of former NASCAR driver St. James Davis, who was mauled by two escaped chimpanzees while he and his wife were celebrating the birthday of their former pet chimpanzee.[190][191] Another example of chimpanzees being aggressive toward humans occurred in 2009 in Stamford, Connecticut, when a 90-kilogram (200 lb), 13-year-old pet chimpanzee named Travis attacked his owner's friend, who lost her hands, eyes, nose, and part of her maxilla from the attack.[192][193]

            Human immunodeficiency virus
            Two primary classes of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infect humans: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the more virulent and easily transmitted, and is the source of the majority of HIV infections throughout the world; HIV-2 occurs mostly in west Africa.[194] Both types originated in west and central Africa, jumping from other primates to humans. HIV-1 has evolved from a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) found in the subspecies P. t. troglodytes of southern Cameroon.[195][196] Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has the greatest genetic diversity of HIV-1 so far discovered, suggesting the virus has been there longer than anywhere else. HIV-2 crossed species from a different strain of HIV, found in the sooty mangabey monkeys in Guinea-Bissau.[194]

            Conservation

            Cameroonian chimpanzee at a rescue centre after its mother was killed by poachers
            The chimpanzee is on the IUCN Red List as an endangered species. Chimpanzees are legally protected in most of their range and are found both in and outside national parks. Between 172,700 and 299,700 individuals are thought to be living in the wild,[2] a decrease from about a million chimpanzees in the early 1900s.[197] Chimpanzees are listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), meaning that commercial international trade in wild-sourced specimens is prohibited and all other international trade (including in parts and derivatives) is regulated by the CITES permitting system.[3]

            The biggest threats to the chimpanzee are habitat destruction, poaching, and disease. Chimpanzee habitats have been limited by deforestation in both West and Central Africa. Road building has caused habitat degradation and fragmentation of chimpanzee populations and may allow poachers more access to areas that had not been seriously affected by humans. Although deforestation rates are low in western Central Africa, selective logging may take place outside national parks.[2]

            Chimpanzees are a common target for poachers. In Ivory Coast, chimpanzees make up 1–3% of bushmeat sold in urban markets. They are also taken, often illegally, for the pet trade and are hunted for medicinal purposes in some areas. Farmers sometimes kill chimpanzees that threaten their crops; others are unintentionally maimed or killed by snares meant for other animals.[2]

            Infectious diseases are a main cause of death for chimpanzees. They succumb to many diseases that afflict humans because the two species are so similar. As the human population grows, so does the risk of disease transmission between humans and chimpanzees.[2]

            Notes
            One captive male, "Kermit", attained a height of 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) and a body weight of 82 kg (181 lb) when he was 11 years old.[39] As a fully grown adult, he weighed almost 136 kg (300 lb).[40]
            According to A. S. Vanesyan's "Anthropology" (2015), a study by "Vorden" (probably 'Worden' or 'Warden') reported that a 54 kg (119 lb) male chimpanzee squeezed 330 kg (730 lb) on a dynamometer, while an angry female squeezed 504 kg (1,111 lb) with both hands. Of the hundreds of human students who also participated in the experiment, only one could squeeze more than 200 kg (440 lb) with both hands.[51] The source is said to be "Jan Dembowskiy, The Psychology of Monkeys."[52] This study is listed in: Dembowski, J. (1946). "Psychology of Monkeys". The Chimpanzee: A Topical Bibliography (PDF) (2nd ed.). Warsaw: Ksrazka. p. 359. Archived from the original (PDF) on 20 July 2021. Retrieved 19 March 2021.

            <p>Spider monkeys are New World monkeys belonging to the genus Ateles, part of the subfamily Atelinae, family Atelidae. Like other atelines, they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Brazil. The genus consists of seven species, all of which are under threat; the brown spider monkey is critically endangered. They are also notable for their ability to be easily bred in captivity.

            Disproportionately long limbs and long prehensile tails make them one of the largest New World monkeys and give rise to their common name. Spider monkeys live in the upper layers of the rainforest and forage in the high canopy, from 25 to 30 m (82 to 98 ft).[2] They primarily eat fruits, but will also occasionally consume leaves, flowers, and insects.[2] Due to their large size, spider monkeys require large tracts of moist evergreen forests, and prefer undisturbed primary rainforest.[2] They are social animals and live in bands of up to 35 individuals, but will split up to forage during the day.[3]

            Recent meta-analyses on primate cognition studies indicated spider monkeys are the most intelligent New World monkeys.[4] They can produce a wide range of sounds and will "bark" when threatened; other vocalisations include a whinny similar to a horse and prolonged screams.[3]

            They are an important food source due to their large size, so are widely hunted by local human populations; they are also threatened by habitat destruction due to logging and land clearing.[3] Spider monkeys are susceptible to malaria and are used in laboratory studies of the disease.[3] The population trend for spider monkeys is decreasing; the IUCN Red List lists one species as vulnerable, five species as endangered and one species as critically endangered.

            Evolutionary history
            Theories abound about the evolution of the atelines; one theory is they are most closely related to the woolly spider monkeys (Brachyteles), and most likely split from woolly monkeys (Lagothrix) in the South American lowland forest, to evolve their unique locomotory system.[5] This theory is not supported by fossil evidence. Other theories include Brachyteles, Lagothrix and Ateles in an unresolved trichotomy,[6] and two clades, one composed of Ateles and Lagothrix and the other of Alouatta and Brachyteles.[7] More recent molecular evidence suggests the Atelinae split in the middle to late Miocene (13 Ma), separating spider monkeys from the woolly spider monkeys and the woolly monkeys.[8]

            Taxonomic classification
            The genus name Ateles derives from the ancient greek word ἀτέλεια (atéleia), meaning "incomplete, imperfect",[9][10] in reference to the reduced or non-existent thumbs of spider monkeys.

            The genus contains seven species, and seven subspecies.[1]

            Spider monkeys are among the largest New World monkeys; black-headed spider monkeys, the largest spider monkey, have an average weight of 11 kilograms (24 lb) for males and 9.66 kg (21.3 lb) for females.[11][12] Disproportionately long, spindly limbs inspired the spider monkey's common name. Their deftly prehensile tails,[13] which may be up to 89 cm (35 in) long, have very flexible, hairless tips and skin grooves similar to fingerprints. This adaptation to their strictly arboreal lifestyle serves as a fifth hand.[14] When the monkey walks, its arms practically drag on the ground. Unlike many monkeys, they do not use their arms for balance when walking, instead relying on their tails. The hands are long, narrow, and hook-like and have reduced or nonexistent thumbs.[15] The fingers are elongated and recurved.[16]

            Their hair is coarse, ranging in color from ruddy gold to brown and black, or white in a rare number of specimens.[17][18] The hands and feet are usually black. Heads are small with hairless faces. The nostrils are very far apart, which is a distinguishing feature of spider monkeys.[19]

            Spider monkeys are highly agile, and they are said to be second only to the gibbons in this respect. They have been seen in the wild jumping from tree to tree.[20]

            Female spider monkeys have a clitoris that is especially developed; it may be referred to as a pseudo-penis because it has an interior passage, or urethra, that makes it almost identical to the penis, and retains and distributes urine droplets as the female moves around. This urine is emptied at the bases of the clitoris, and collects in skin folds on either side of a groove on the perineal.[21] Researchers and observers of spider monkeys of South America look for a scrotum to determine the animal sex because these female spider monkeys have pendulous and erectile clitorises long enough to be mistaken for a penis; researchers may also determine the animal's sex by identifying scent-marking glands that may be present on the clitoris.[22]

            Behavior

            As is the case with all species of spider monkeys, the brown spider monkey is threatened by hunting and habitat loss.
            Spider monkeys form loose groups, typically with 15 to 25 individuals,[23] but sometimes up to 30 or 40.[24][25] During the day, groups break up into subgroups. The size of subgroups and the degree to which they avoid each other during the day depends on food competition and the risk of predation. The average subgroup size is between 2 and 8[26] but can sometimes be up to 17 animals.[25] Also less common in primates, females rather than males disperse at puberty to join new groups. Males tend to stick together for their whole lives. Hence, males in a group are more likely to be related and have closer bonds than females. Males also cement bonds through "grappling": prolonged hugging, face greeting, tail intertwining, and genital manipulation.[27] However, the strongest social bonds are between females and their young offspring.[28]

            Spider monkeys communicate their intentions and observations using postures and stances, such as postures of sexual receptivity and of attack. When a spider monkey sees a human approaching, it barks loudly similar to a dog. When a monkey is approached, it climbs to the end of the branch it is on and shakes it vigorously to scare away the possible threat. It shakes the branches with its feet, hands, or a combination while hanging from its tail. It may also scratch its limbs or body with various parts of its hands and feet. Seated monkeys may sway and make noise. Males and occasionally adult females growl menacingly at the approach of a human. If the pursuer continues to advance, the monkeys may break off live or dead tree limbs weighing up to 4 kilograms (8.8 lb) and drop them towards the intruder. The monkeys also defecate and urinate toward the intruder.[29]

            Spider monkeys are diurnal and spend the night sleeping in carefully selected trees. Groups are thought to be directed by a lead female, which is responsible for planning an efficient feeding route each day. Grooming is not as important to social interaction, owing perhaps to a lack of thumbs.[30]

            Spider monkeys have been observed avoiding the upper canopy of the trees for locomotion.[31] One researcher speculated this was because the thin branches at the tops of trees do not support the monkeys as well.[32]

            At 107 grams (3.8 oz), the spider monkey brain is twice the size of the brain of a howler monkey of equivalent body size;[33] this is thought to be a result of the spider monkeys' complex social system and their frugivorous diets, which consist primarily of ripe fruit from a wide variety (over 150 species) of plants. This requires the monkeys to remember when and where fruit can be found. The slow development may also play a role: the monkeys may live from 20[34] to 27 years or more, and females give birth once every 17 to 45 months.[35] Gummy, presumably the oldest spider monkey in captivity, is presumed to have been born wild in 1962, resided at Fort Rickey Children's Discovery Zoo located in Rome, New York,[36] and died at the age of 61, after living about twice as long as the average spider monkey.[37]

            Diet

            Spider monkeys eat fleshy fruits 71 to 83 percent of the time.[31] They can live for long periods on only one or two kinds of fruits and nuts. They eat the fruits of many big forest trees, and because they swallow fruits whole, the seeds are eventually excreted and fertilized by the feces. Studies show the diet of spider monkeys changes their reproductive, social, and physical behavioral patterns. Most feeding happens from dawn to 10 am. Afterward, the adults rest while the young play. Through the rest of the day, they may feed infrequently until around 10 pm. If food is scarce, they may eat insects, leaves, bird eggs, bark and honey.[38]

            Spider monkeys have a unique way of getting food: a lead female is generally responsible for finding food sources. If she cannot find enough food for the group, it splits into smaller groups that forage separately.[citation needed] The traveling groups have four to nine animals. Each group is closely associated with its territory.[39] If the group is big, it spreads out.

            Reproduction
            The female chooses a male from her group for mating. Both males and females use "anogenital sniffing" to check their mates for readiness for copulation. The gestation period ranges from 226 to 232 days. Each female bears only one offspring on average, every three to four years.[30]

            Until six to ten months of age, infants rely completely on their mothers.[29] Males are not involved in raising the offspring.

            A mother carries her infant around her belly for the first month after birth. After this, she carries it on her lower back. The infant wraps its tail around its mother's and tightly grabs her midsection.[34] Mothers are very protective of their young and are generally attentive mothers. They have been seen grabbing their young and putting them on their backs for protection and to help them navigate from tree to tree. They help the more independent young to cross by pulling branches closer together. Mothers also groom their young.

            Male spider monkeys are one of the few primates that do not have a penis bone (baculum).[40][41]

            Spider monkeys are found in many aspects of the Mesoamerican cultures. In the Aztec 260-day calendar, Spider Monkey (Nahua Ozomatli) serves as the name for the 11th day. In the corresponding Maya calendar, Howler Monkey (Batz) is substituted for Spider Monkey.[42] In present-day Maya religious feasts, spider monkey impersonators serve as a kind of demonic clowns.[43] In Classical Maya art, they are ubiquitous, often shown carrying cacao pods.

            <p>The proboscis monkey or long-nosed monkey (Nasalis larvatus) is an arboreal Old World monkey with an unusually large nose (or proboscis), a reddish-brown skin color and a long tail. It is endemic to the Southeast Asian island of Borneo and is found mostly in mangrove forests and on the coastal areas of the island.[3]

            This species co-exists with the Bornean orangutan and monkeys such as the silvery lutung.[4] It belongs in the monotypic genus Nasalis.[5][6]

            Taxonomy
            The proboscis monkey belongs to the subfamily Colobinae of the Old World monkeys. The two subspecies are:[2]

            N. l. larvatus (Wurmb, 1787), which occupies the whole range of the species excluding northeast Kalimantan[7]
            N. l. orientalis (Chasen, 1940), restricted to north-east Kalimantan[7]
            However, the difference between the subspecies is small, and not all authorities recognise N. l. orientalis.[2]

            The genus name Nasalis comes from the Latin word nasus meaning "nose".[8][further explanation needed][additional citation(s) needed]

            This animal was made known to Westerners by Baron Friedrich von Wurmb in 1781, he later sent specimens of it to Stamford Raffles in Europe.[9][additional citation(s) needed]

            Description

            Male

            Female
            The proboscis monkey is a large species, being one of the largest monkey species native to Asia. Only the Tibetan macaque and a few of the gray langurs can rival its size.

            Sexual dimorphism is pronounced in the species. Males have a head-body length of 66 to 76.2 cm (26.0 to 30.0 in) and typically weigh 16 to 22.5 kg (35 to 50 lb), with a maximum known weight of 30 kg (66 lb). Females measure 53.3 to 62 cm (21.0 to 24.4 in) in head-and-body length and weigh 7 to 12 kg (15 to 26 lb), with a maximum known mass of 15 kg (33 lb).[10][11][12] The male has a red penis with a black scrotum.[13]

            The proboscis monkey has a long coat; the fur on the back is bright orange, reddish brown, yellowish brown or brick-red.[13][14] The underfur is light-grey, yellowish, or greyish to light-orange.[13][14] Infants are born with a blue coloured face that at 2.5 months darkens to grey. By 8.5 months of age, the face has become cream coloured like the adults.[15] Both sexes have bulging stomachs that give the monkeys what resembles a pot belly. Many of the monkeys' toes are webbed.[13]

            Nose

            Further adding to the dimorphism is the large nose or proboscis of the male, which can exceed 10.2 cm (4.0 in) in length,[16] and hangs lower than the mouth. Theories for the extensive length of their nose suggest it may be sexual selection by the females, who prefer louder vocalisations, with the size of the nose increasing the volume of the call.[17][13][14]

            The nose is smaller in the female and is upturned in the young.[18] Nevertheless, the nose of the female is still fairly large for a primate. The skull of the proboscis monkey has specialized nasal cartilages that support the large nose.[3]

            Distribution and habitat

            Juvenile in Labuk Bay, Sabah
            The proboscis monkey is endemic to the island of Borneo and can be found in all three nations that divide the island: Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia.[19] It is most common in coastal areas and along rivers.[20] This species is restricted to lowland habitats that may experience tides.[21][22] It favors dipterocarp, mangrove and riverine forests.[20] It can also be found in swamp forests, stunted swamp forests, rubber forests, rubber plantations, limestone hill forests, nypa swamps, nibong swamps, tall swamp forests, tropical heath forests and steep cliffs.[21] This species usually stays within at least a kilometer from a water source. It is perhaps the most aquatic of the primates and is a fairly good swimmer, capable of swimming up to 20 m (66 ft) underwater. It is known to swim across rivers.[21] Aside from this, the proboscis monkey is largely arboreal and moves quadrupedally and by leaps.[10] It is known to jump off branches and descend into water.[23]

            A group by the river Kinabatangan
            Proboscis monkeys generally live in groups composed of one adult male, some adult females and their offspring.[20][23][24] All-male groups may also exist.[25] Some individuals are solitary, mostly males.[26] Monkey groups live in overlapping home ranges, with little territoriality,[20][23] in a fission-fusion society, with groups gathering at sleeping sites as night falls. There exist bands which arise when groups come together and slip apart yet sometimes groups may join to mate and groom.[20][23][24] Groups gather during the day and travel together, but individuals only groom and play with those in their own group.[24] One-male groups consist of 3 to 19 individuals,[25][20] while bands can consist of as many as 60 individuals.[20][26] Serious aggression is uncommon among the monkeys but minor aggression does occur.[27] Overall, members of the same bands are fairly tolerant of each other. A linear dominance hierarchy exists between females.[23] Males of one-male groups can stay in their groups for six to eight years. Replacements in the resident males appear to occur without serious aggression.[25] Upon reaching adulthood, males leave their natal groups and join all-male groups.[20][26] Females also sometimes leave their natal groups, perhaps to avoid infanticide or inbreeding, reduce competition for food, or elevation of their social status.[25][26]

            In Sabah, Malaysia, proboscis monkeys have been observed in mixed-species groups with silvery lutungs, and interspecific mating and a possible hybrid has been observed.[6] Researchers believe this may be a result of the two species being confined to a small patch of riverine forest due to deforestation in order to plant oil palm trees.[6]

            Reproduction
            Females become sexually mature at the age of five years. They experience sexual swelling, which involves the genitals becoming pink or reddened.[25][28] At one site, matings largely take place between February and November, while births occur between March and May.[29] Copulations tend to last for half a minute.[23][25] The male will grab the female by the ankles or torso and mount her from behind.[23] Both sexes will encourage mating, but they are not always successful.[28] When soliciting, both sexes will make pouted faces. In addition, males will sometimes vocalize and females will present their backsides and shake their head from side to side.[20][28][29][15] Mating pairs are sometimes harassed by subadults.[28] Proboscis monkeys may also engage in mounting with no reproductive purpose, such as playful and same-sex mounting, and females will attempt to initiate copulation even after they have conceived.[15] Gestation usually last 166–200 days or slightly more.[29] Females tend to give birth at night or in the early morning. The mothers then eat the placenta and lick their infants clean.[30] The young begin to eat solid foods at six weeks and are weaned at seven months old. The nose of a young male grows slowly until reaching adulthood. The mother will allow other members of her group to hold her infant.[23][29][30] When a resident male in a one-male group is replaced, the infants are at risk of infanticide.[31]

            Communication
            Proboscis monkeys are known to make various vocalizations. When communicating the status of group, males will emit honks. They have a special honk emitted towards infants, which is also used for reassurance. Males will also produce alarm calls to signal danger. Both sexes give threat calls, but each are different. In addition, females and immature individuals will emit so-called "female calls" when angry.[32] Honks, roars and snarls are made during low-intensity agonistic encounters. Nonvocal displays include leaping-branch shaking, bare-teeth open mouth threats and erection in males, made in the same situations.[23]

            Feeding and activities
            As a seasonal folivore and frugivore, the proboscis monkey eats primarily fruit and leaves.[23] It also eats flowers, seeds and insects to a lesser extent. At least 55 different plant species are consumed, "with a marked preference for Eugenia sp., Ganua motleyana and Lophopetalum javanicum".[33] Young leaves are preferred over mature leaves and unripe fruits are preferred over ripe fruit.[23] Being a seasonal eater, the proboscis monkey eats mostly fruit from January to May and mostly leaves from June to December.[33] Groups usually sleep in adjacent trees.[34] Monkeys tend to sleep near rivers, if they are nearby. Proboscis monkeys will start the day foraging and then rest further inland. Their daily activities consist of resting, traveling, feeding and keeping vigilant.[23] Occasionally, they chew their cud to allow more efficient digestion and food intake.[35] As night approaches, the monkeys move back near the river and forage again. Predators (potential or confirmed) of the proboscis monkey include crocodilians like false gharials and saltwater crocodiles, the Sunda clouded leopard, sun bears and reticulated pythons as well as, for probably young or sickly monkeys, large eagles (such as the crested serpent eagle or black eagle), large owls, and monitor lizards.[36][37] Monkeys will cross rivers at narrows or cross arboreally if possible.

            The proboscis monkey is assessed as endangered in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and listed in Appendix I of CITES. Its total population has decreased by more than 50% in the past 36–40 years to 2008 due to ongoing habitat loss because of logging and oil palm plantations, and hunting in some areas due to the species being treated as a delicacy, as well as its use in traditional Chinese medicine.[15] The population is fragmented: the largest remaining populations are found in Kalimantan; there are far fewer in Sarawak, Brunei and Sabah.[2] The proboscis monkey is protected by law in all regions of Borneo. In Malaysia, it is protected by a number of laws including the Wildlife Protection Act (federal law), the Wildlife Protection Ordinance 1998 (Chapter 26) and Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 (Sabah state law).

            The proboscis monkey can be found in 16 protected areas: Danau Sentarum National Park, Gunung Palung National Park, Kendawangan Nature Reserve, Kutai National Park, Lesan Protection Forest, Muara Kaman Nature Reserve, Mandor Reserve and Tanjung Puting National Park in Indonesia; Bako National Park, Gunung Pueh Forest Reserve, Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve, Klias National Park, Kulamba Wildlife Reserve, Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, Sungei Samunsam Wildlife Sanctuary and Ulu Segama Reserve in Malaysia.[2]
