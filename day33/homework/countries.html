        <p>Canada[a] is a country in North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, making it the second-largest country by total area, with the longest coastline of any country. Its border with the United States is the longest international land border. The country is characterized by a wide range of both meteorologic and geological regions. With a population of over 41 million, it has widely varying population densities, with the majority residing in its urban areas and large areas being sparsely populated. Canada's capital is Ottawa and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.

        Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories resulting in the displacement of Indigenous populations, and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. This increased sovereignty was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster, 1931, and culminated in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

        Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The country's head of government is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons and is appointed by the governor general, representing the monarch of Canada, the ceremonial head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is very highly ranked in international measurements of government transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness, innovation, education and human rights. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its history, economy, and culture.

        A developed country, Canada has a high nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world by nominal GDP, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Recognized as a middle power, Canada's support for multilateralism and internationalism has been closely related to its foreign policies of peacekeeping and aid for developing countries. Canada promotes its domestically shared values through participation in multiple international organizations and forums.

        Etymology
        Main article: Name of Canada
        While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning "village" or "settlement".[9] In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona.[10] Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona);[10] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as Canada.[10]

        From the 16th to the early 18th century, Canada referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint Lawrence River.[11] Following the British conquest of New France, this area was known as the British Province of Quebec from 1763 to 1791.[12] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada. These two colonies were collectively referred to as the Canadas until their union as the Province of Canada in 1841.[13]

        Upon Confederation in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference and the word dominion was conferred as the country's title.[14] By the 1950s, the term Dominion of Canada was no longer used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a "realm of the Commonwealth".[15]

        The Canada Act 1982, which brought the Constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control, referred only to Canada. Later that year, the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day.[16]

        History
        Main article: History of Canada

        Indigenous peoples
        The first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago.[17] The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.[18] The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks.[19] Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.[20] Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis,[21] the last being of mixed descent who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and their offspring subsequently developed their own identity.[21]

        The Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000[23] and two million,[24] with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.[25] As a consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent.[26] The decline is attributed to several causes, including the transfer of European diseases, to which they had no natural immunity,[27] conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.[28]

        Although not without conflict, European Canadians' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful.[29] First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureurs des bois and voyageurs in their explorations of the continent during the North American fur trade.[30] These early European interactions with First Nations would change from friendship and peace treaties to the dispossession of Indigenous lands through treaties.[31] From the late 18th century, European Canadians forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a western Canadian society.[32] Settler colonialism reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[33] A period of redress began with the formation of a reconciliation commission by the Government of Canada in 2008.[34] This included acknowledgment of cultural genocide,[35] settlement agreements,[34] and betterment of racial discrimination issues, such as addressing the plight of missing and murdered Indigenous women.[36]

        European colonization

        It is believed that the first documented European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif Erikson.[38] In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland.[39] No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of Henry VII of England.[40] In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words, "long live the King of France", and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis I.[41] The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and Portuguese establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast.[42] In general, early settlements during the Age of Discovery appear to have been short-lived due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia.[43]

        In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St John's, Newfoundland, as the first North American English seasonal camp.[44] In 1600, the French established their first seasonal trading post at Tadoussac along the Saint Lawrence.[39] French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608).[45] Among the colonists of New France, Canadiens extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day Maritimes, while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana.[46] The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade.[47]

        The English established additional settlements in Newfoundland in 1610 along with settlements in the Thirteen Colonies to the south.[48] A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War.[49] Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War.[50]

        The Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia.[16] St John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769.[52] To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.[53] More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule.[54] It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies.[55] The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution.[16]

        After the successful American War of Independence, the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the newly formed United States and set the terms of peace, ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country.[56] The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of Loyalists, the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. New Brunswick was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the incorporation of Saint John, New Brunswick, as Canada's first city.[57] To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in Central Canada, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French-speaking Lower Canada (later Quebec) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later Ontario), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.[58]

        The Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom. Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed.[60] Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850.[61] New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Gaelic-speaking Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances.[62] Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891.[23]

        The desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837.[63] The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture.[16] The Act of Union 1840 merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America east of Lake Superior by 1855.[64] The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858).[65] The Anglo-Russian Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825) established the border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US Alaska Purchase of 1867, disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska–Yukon and Alaska–British Columbia border.[66]

        Confederation and expansion
        Refer to caption

        Following three constitutional conferences, the British North America Act, 1867 officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.[68] Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories, where the Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870.[69] British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years,[70] while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873.[71] In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory. Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905.[71] Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated south to the US.[72]

        To open the West and encourage European immigration, the Government of Canada sponsored the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway), passed the Dominion Lands Act to regulate settlement and established the North-West Mounted Police to assert authority over the territory.[73] This period of westward expansion and nation building resulted in the displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the Canadian Prairies to "Indian reserves",[74] clearing the way for ethnic European block settlements.[75] This caused the collapse of the Plains Bison in western Canada and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating the land.[76] The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands.[77] The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves.[78] During this time, Canada introduced the Indian Act extending its control over the First Nations to education, government and legal rights.[79]

        Because Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the British North America Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into the First World War.[80] Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of the Canadian Corps, which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of the war.[81] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers.[82] In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain,[81] and the Statute of Westminster, 1931, affirmed Canada's independence.[83]

        The Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country.[84] In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s.[85] On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.[81]

        The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during the Second World War.[86] Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid, the Allied invasion of Italy, the Normandy landings, the Battle of Normandy, and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944.[81] Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi Germany.[87] Despite another conscription crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.[88]

        Contemporary era
        The financial crisis of the Great Depression led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a Crown colony ruled by a British governor.[89] After two referendums, Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.[90]

        Canada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the maple leaf flag in 1965,[91] the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969,[92] and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971.[93] Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans; though, provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.[94]

        Finally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the Canada Act 1982, the patriation of Canada's constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[96] Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country under its own monarchy.[97] In 1999, Nunavut became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government.[98]

        At the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, giving birth to a secular nationalist movement.[99] The radical Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) ignited the October Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970,[100] and the sovereigntist Parti Québécois was elected in 1976, organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990.[101] This led to the formation of the Bloc Québécois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West.[102] A second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent.[103] In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional, and the Clarity Act was passed by Parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation.[101]

        In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history;[104] the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university shooting targeting female students;[105] and the Oka Crisis of 1990,[106] the first of a number of violent confrontations between provincial governments and Indigenous groups.[107] Canada joined the Gulf War in 1990 and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including operations in the Balkans during and after the Yugoslav Wars,[108] and in Somalia, resulting in an incident that has been described as "the darkest era in the history of the Canadian military".[109] Canada sent troops to Afghanistan in 2001, resulting in the largest amount of Canadian deaths for any single military mission since the Korean War in the early 1950s.[110]

        In 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into the Libyan Civil War[111] and also became involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s.[112] The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada began on January 27, 2020, causing widespread social and economic disruption.[113] In 2021, possible gravesites of Indigenous children were found near former Canadian residential schools, highlighting the cultural genocide against Indigenous peoples.[114] A trade war involving the United States began on February 1, 2025, when U.S. president Donald Trump signed orders imposing tariffs on goods entering the United States.[115]

        By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country.[116] By land area alone, Canada ranks fourth, due to having the world's largest area of fresh water lakes.[117] Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, along the Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in the west, the country encompasses 9,984,670 square kilometres (3,855,100 sq mi) of territory.[118] Canada also has vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi).[119] In addition to sharing the world's largest land border with the United States—spanning 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi)[b]—Canada shares a land border with Greenland (and hence the Kingdom of Denmark) to the northeast, on Hans Island,[120] and a maritime boundary with France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the southeast.[121] Canada is also home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island—latitude 82.5°N—which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) from the North Pole.[122] In latitude, Canada's most northerly point of land is Cape Columbia in Nunavut at 83°6′41″N, with its southern extreme at Middle Island in Lake Erie at 41°40′53″N. In longitude, Canada's land extends from Cape Spear, Newfoundland, at 52°37'W, to Mount St. Elias, Yukon Territory, at 141°W.[123]

        Canada can be divided into seven physiographic regions: the Canadian Shield, the Interior Plains, the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Appalachian region, the Western Cordillera, Hudson Bay Lowlands, and the Arctic Archipelago.[124] Boreal forests prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in northern Arctic regions and through the Rocky Mountains, and the relatively flat Canadian Prairies in the southwest facilitate productive agriculture.[118] The Great Lakes feed the St. Lawrence River (in the southeast) where the lowlands host much of Canada's economic output.[118] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 of which are larger than 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi)—containing much of the world's fresh water.[125] There are also fresh-water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies, the Coast Mountains, and the Arctic Cordillera.[126] Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes.[127]

        Climate
        Main articles: Temperature in Canada and Climate change in Canada

        Köppen climate classification types of Canada
        Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills.[128] In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).[129]

        Much of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost. The future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada.[130] Canada's annual average temperature over land has risen by 1.7 °C (3.1 °F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 °C (2.0 to 4.1 °F) in various regions, since 1948.[118] The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies.[131] In the southern regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and the United States—caused by metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions—has resulted in acid rain, which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth, and agricultural productivity.[132] Canada is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters globally,[133] with emissions increased by 16.5 percent between 1990 and 2022.[134]

        Terrestrial ecozones and ecoprovinces of Canada. Ecozones are identified with a unique colour. Ecoprovinces are subdivisions of ecozones and are identified with a unique numeric code.[135]
        Canada is divided into 15 terrestrial and five marine ecozones.[136] These ecozones encompass over 80,000 classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered.[137] Although Canada has a low percentage of endemic species compared to other countries,[138] due to human activities, invasive species, and environmental issues in the country, there are currently more than 800 species at risk of being lost.[139] About 65 percent of Canada's resident species are considered "Secure".[140] Over half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development.[141] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with approximately 3,000,000 square kilometres (1,200,000 sq mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry.[142] Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions.[143]

        Approximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas, including 11.4 percent designated as protected areas.[144] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas.[144] Canada's first National Park, Banff National Park was established in 1885.[145] Canada's oldest provincial park, Algonquin Provincial Park was established in 1893.[146] Established in 2015, Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area is the world's largest freshwater protected area.[147] Canada's largest national wildlife region, established in 2018, is the Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area.[148]

        Government and politics
        Main articles: Government of Canada and Politics of Canada

        Aerial view of Canadian Parliament Buildings and their surroundings
        Canada is described as a "full democracy",[149] with a tradition of liberalism,[150] and an egalitarian,[151] moderate political ideology.[152] An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture.[153] Peace, order, and good government, alongside an Implied Bill of Rights, are founding principles of Canadian federalism.[154]

        At the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two relatively centrist parties practising "brokerage politics":[c] the centre-left leaning Liberal Party of Canada[157] and the centre-right leaning Conservative Party of Canada (or its predecessors).[158] The historically predominant Liberals position themselves at the centre of the political scale.[158] Five parties had representatives elected to Parliament in the 2025 election—the Liberals, who formed a minority government; the Conservatives, who became the Official Opposition; the Bloc Québécois; the New Democratic Party (occupying the left[159]); and the Green Party.[160] Far-right and far-left politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society.[161]

        Canada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy—the monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.[162] The reigning monarch is also monarch of 14 other sovereign Commonwealth countries[163] and Canada's 10 provinces. The monarch appoints a representative, the governor general, on the advice of the prime minister, to carry out most of their ceremonial royal duties.[164]

        The monarchy is the source of sovereignty and authority in Canada.[165] However, while the governor general or monarch may exercise their power without ministerial advice in rare crisis situations,[166] the use of the executive powers (or royal prerogative) is otherwise directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the prime minister,[167] the head of government. To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a majority of members in the House.[168] The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is one of the most powerful institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies.[166] The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the leader of the Official Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.[169]

        The House of Commons chamber
        The House of Commons in its temporary location, the West Block[170]
        The Parliament of Canada passes all federal statute laws. It comprises the monarch, the House of Commons, and the Senate. While Canada inherited the British concept of parliamentary supremacy, this was later, with the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, all but completely superseded by the American notion of the supremacy of the law.[171]

        Each of the 343 members of Parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. The Constitution Act, 1982, requires that no more than five years pass between elections, although the Canada Elections Act limits this to four years with a "fixed" election date in October; general elections still must be called by the governor general and can be triggered by either the advice of the prime minister or a lost confidence vote in the House.[172] The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75.[173]

        Canadian federalism divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the 10 provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons.[174] Canada's three territories also have legislatures, but these are not sovereign, have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces,[175] and differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.[176]

        Law
        Main article: Law of Canada
        The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country and consists of written text and unwritten conventions.[177] The Constitution Act, 1867 (known as the British North America Act, 1867 prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments.[178] The Statute of Westminster, 1931, granted full autonomy, and the Constitution Act, 1982, ended all legislative ties to Britain, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[179] The Charter guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be overridden by any government; a notwithstanding clause allows Parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter for a period of five years.[180]

        Supreme Court of Canada building
        The Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa, west of Parliament Hill
        Canada's judiciary interprets laws and has the power to strike down acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court, final arbiter, and has been led since 2017 by Richard Wagner, the Chief Justice of Canada.[181] The governor general appoints the court's nine members on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice.[182] The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions.[183]

        Common law prevails everywhere except Quebec, where civil law predominates.[184] Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada.[185] Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially a provincial responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police forces.[186] In most rural and some urban areas, policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police.[187]

        Canadian Aboriginal law provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices for Indigenous groups in Canada.[188] Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and many Indigenous peoples.[189] The role of Aboriginal law and the rights they support were reaffirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.[189] These rights may include provision of services, such as healthcare through the Indian Health Transfer Policy, and exemption from taxation.[190]

        Provinces and territories

        Political map of Canada showing its 10 provinces and 3 territories[191]
        Canada is a federation composed of 10 federated states, called provinces, and three federal territories. These may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together).[192] Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare, education, and social programs,[193] as well as administration of justice (but not criminal law). Although the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.[194]

        The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their sovereignty from the Crown[195] and power and authority from the Constitution Act, 1867, whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada[196] and the commissioners represent the King in his federal Council,[197] rather than the monarch directly. The powers flowing from the Constitution Act, 1867, are divided between the federal government and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively[198] and any changes to that arrangement require a constitutional amendment, while changes to the roles and powers of the territories may be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada.[199]

        Canada
        Canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in global affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral and international solutions.[201] Canada is known for its commitment to international peace and security, as well as being a mediator in conflicts,[202] and for providing aid to developing countries.[203]

        Canada and the United States have a long and complex relationship;[204] historically close allies, they co-operate regularly on military campaigns and humanitarian efforts.[205] Canada also maintains historic and traditional ties to the United Kingdom and to France,[206] along with both countries' former colonies through its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie.[207] Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during the Second World War.[87] Canada has diplomatic and consular offices in over 270 locations in approximately 180 foreign countries.[200]

        Canada promotes its domestically shared values through participating in multiple international organizations.[208] Canada was a founding member of the United Nations (UN) in 1945 and formed the North American Aerospace Defense Command together with the United States in 1958.[209] The country has membership in the World Trade Organization, the Five Eyes, the G7 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).[210] The country was a founding member the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) in 1989 and joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990.[211] Canada ratified the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948, and seven principal UN human rights conventions and covenants since then.[212]

        Alongside many domestic obligations, more than 3,000 Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) personnel are deployed in multiple foreign military operations.[214] The Canadian unified forces comprise the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force. The nation employs a professional, volunteer force of approximately 68,000 active personnel and 27,000 reserve personnel—increasing to 71,500 and 30,000 respectively under "Strong, Secure, Engaged"[215]—with a sub-component of approximately 5,000 Canadian Rangers.[216][d] In 2022, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately $26.9 billion, or around 1.2 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) – placing it 14th for military expenditure by country.[218]

        Canada's role in developing peacekeeping and its participation in major peacekeeping initiatives during the 20th century has played a major role in its positive global image.[219] Peacekeeping is deeply embedded in Canadian culture and a distinguishing feature that Canadians feel sets their foreign policy apart from the United States.[220] Canada has long been reluctant to participate in military operations that are not sanctioned by the United Nations,[221] such as the Vietnam War or the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[221] Since the 21st century, Canadian direct participation in UN peacekeeping efforts has greatly declined.[222] The large decrease was a result of Canada directing its participation to UN-sanctioned military operations through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, rather than directly through the UN.[223] The change to participation via NATO has resulted in a shift towards more militarized and deadly missions rather than traditional peacekeeping duties.[224]

        Economy
        Main article: Economy of Canada

        The Toronto financial district is the second-largest financial centre in North America, the seventh-largest globally in employment and the heart of Canada's finance industry.[225]
        Canada's mixed-market economy[226] is highly developed, ranking as the world's ninth-largest by nominal GDP as of 2023, at approximately US$2.221 trillion.[227] The country is one of the world's largest trading nations, with a highly globalized economy.[228] In 2021, Canadian trade in goods and services reached $2.016 trillion.[229] Canada's exports totalled over $637 billion, while its imported goods were worth over $631 billion, of which approximately $391 billion originated from the United States.[229] In 2018, Canada had a trade deficit in goods of $22 billion and a trade deficit in services of $25 billion.[229] The Toronto Stock Exchange is the ninth-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of over US$2 trillion.[230]

        The Bank of Canada is the central bank of the country.[231] The minister of finance and minister of innovation, science, and industry use data from Statistics Canada to enable financial planning and develop economic policy.[232] Canada has a strong cooperative banking sector, with the world's highest per-capita membership in credit unions.[233] It ranks low in the Corruption Perceptions Index (14th in 2023)[234] and "is widely regarded as among the least corrupt countries of the world".[235] It ranks high in the Global Competitiveness Report (19th in 2024).[236] Canada's economy ranks above most Western nations on the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom[237] and experiences a relatively low level of income disparity.[238] The country's average household disposable income per capita is "well above" the OECD average.[239] Canada ranks among the lowest of the most developed countries for housing affordability[240] and foreign direct investment.[241]

        Since the early 20th century, the growth of Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one.[242] The Canadian economy is dominated by the service industry, which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce.[243] Canada has an unusually important primary sector, of which the forestry and petroleum industries are the most prominent components.[244] Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustained by nearby mines or sources of timber.[245]


        Canada
        Countries and territories with free-trade agreements[246]
        Canada's economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since the Second World War.[247] The Canada – United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994 (later replaced by the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement).[248] As of 2023, Canada is a signatory to 15 free trade agreements with 51 different countries.[246]

        Canada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy.[249] Atlantic Canada possess vast offshore deposits of natural gas,[250] and Alberta hosts the fourth-largest oil reserves in the world.[251] The vast Athabasca oil sands and other oil reserves give Canada 13 percent of global oil reserves, constituting the world's third- or fourth-largest.[252] Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies region is one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains.[253] Canada's main exports are zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, platinoids, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal, lead, copper, molybdenum, cobalt, and cadmium.[254] Canada has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.[255] The country's fishing industry is also a key contributor to the economy.[256]

        Science and technology
        Main article: Science and technology in Canada
        In 2020, Canada spent approximately $41.9 billion on domestic research and development, with supplementary estimates for 2022 at $43.2 billion.[257] As of 2023, the country has produced 15 Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and medicine.[258] The country ranks seventh in the worldwide share of articles published in scientific journals, according to the Nature Index,[259] and is home to the headquarters of a number of global technology firms.[260] Canada has one of the highest levels of Internet access in the world, with approximately 95 percent of its population aged 15 and above.[261]


        The Canadian-built Space Shuttle robotic arm (left), referred to as Canadarm, transferred the P5 truss segment over to the Canadian-built space station robotic arm, referred to as Canadarm2.[262]
        Canada's achievements in science and technology include the creation of the modern alkaline battery,[263] the discovery of insulin,[264] the development of the polio vaccine,[265] and discoveries about the interior structure of the atomic nucleus.[266] Other major Canadian scientific contributions include the artificial cardiac pacemaker, mapping the visual cortex,[267] the development of the electron microscope,[268] plate tectonics, deep learning, multi-touch technology, and the identification of the first black hole, Cygnus X-1.[269] Canada has a long history of discovery in genetics, which include stem cells, site-directed mutagenesis, T-cell receptor, and the identification of the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis, and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases.[270]

        The Canadian Space Agency runs an active space program focused on deep-space, planetary, and aviation research, along with rockets and satellites.[271] Canada launched its first satellite, Alouette 1, in 1962.[272] It contributes to the International Space Station and is known for its robotic tools, such as multiple Canadarms.[273] Canada has initiated many long-term projects, including the Radarsat satellite series and the Black Brant rocket series.[274]

        The 2021 Canadian census enumerated a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016 figure.[276] It is estimated that Canada's population surpassed 40,000,000 in 2023.[277] The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth.[278] Canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world,[279] driven mainly by economic policy and family reunification.[280] A record 483,390 immigrants were admitted in 2024.[281] Canada leads the world in refugee resettlement; it resettled more than 47,600 in 2022.[282] New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas, such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.[283]

        Canada's population density, at 4.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (11/sq mi), is among the lowest in the world,[276] with approximately 95 percent of the population residing south of the 55th parallel north.[284] About 80 percent of the population lives within 150 kilometres (93 mi) of the border with the contiguous United States.[285] Canada is highly urbanized, with over 80 percent of the population living in urban centres.[286] The majority of Canadians (over 70 percent ) live below the 49th parallel, with 50 percent of Canadians living south of 45°42′ (45.7 degrees) north.[287] The most densely populated part of the country is the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor in Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.[288]

        The majority of Canadians (81.1 percent) live in family households, 12.1 percent report living alone, and 6.8 percent live with other relatives or unrelated persons.[289] Fifty-one percent of households are couples with or without children, 8.7 percent are single-parent households, 2.9 percent are multigenerational households, and 29.3 percent are single-person households.[289]

        Ethnicity
        Main article: Ethnic origins of people in Canada
        Respondents in the 2021 Canadian census self-reported over 450 "ethnic or cultural origins".[291] The major panethnic groups chosen were: European (52.5 percent), North American (22.9 percent), Asian (19.3 percent), North American Indigenous (6.1 percent), African (3.8 percent), Latin, Central and South American (2.5 percent), Caribbean (2.1 percent), Oceanian (0.3 percent), and other (6 percent).[292] Over 60 percent of Canadians reported a single origin, and 36 percent reported having multiple ethnic origins, thus the overall total is greater than 100 percent.[291]


        The top 168 ethnic or cultural origins self-reported by Canadians in the 2021 census[293]
        The country's ten largest self-reported ethnic or cultural origins in 2021 were Canadian[e] (accounting for 15.6 percent of the population), followed by English (14.7 percent), Irish (12.1 percent), Scottish (12.1 percent), French (11.0 percent), German (8.1 percent), Chinese (4.7 percent), Italian (4.3 percent), Indian (3.7 percent), and Ukrainian (3.5 percent).[296]

        Of the 36.3 million people enumerated in 2021, approximately 25.4 million reported being "White", representing 69.8 percent of the population.[297][298] The Indigenous population representing 5 percent or 1.8 million people, grew by 9.4 percent compared to the non-Indigenous population, which grew by 5.3 percent from 2016 to 2021.[298] One out of every four Canadians or 26.5 percent of the population belonged to a non-White and non-Indigenous visible minority,[299][f] the largest of which in 2021 were South Asian (2.6 million people; 7.1 percent), Chinese (1.7 million; 4.7 percent), Black (1.5 million; 4.3 percent), Filipinos (960,000 2.6 percent), Arabs (690,000; 1.9 percent), Latin Americans (580,000; 1.6 percent), Southeast Asians (390,000; 1.1 percent), West Asians (360,000; 1.0 percent), Koreans (220,000; 0.6 percent) and Japanese (99,000; 0.3 percent).[301]

        Between 2011 and 2016, the visible minority population rose by 18.4 percent.[302] In 1961, about 300,000 people, less than two percent of Canada's population, were members of visible minority groups.[303] The 2021 census indicated that 8.3 million people, or almost one-quarter (23.0 percent) of the population, reported themselves as being or having been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada—above the 1921 census previous record of 22.3 percent.[304] In 2021, India, China, and the Philippines were the top three countries of origin for immigrants moving to Canada.[305]

        Languages
        Main article: Languages of Canada

        Percentage of the population who could conduct a conversation in English and French in 2021[306]
        A multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 54 percent and 19 percent of Canadians, respectively.[289] Canada's official bilingualism policies give citizens the right to receive federal government services in either English or French with official-language minorities guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.[307]

        Quebec's 1974 Official Language Act established French as the only official language of the province.[308] Although more than 82 percent of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial Francophone populations in New Brunswick, Alberta, and Manitoba, with Ontario having the largest French-speaking population outside Quebec.[309] New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province, has an Acadian French minority constituting 33 percent of the population.[310] There are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, and in central and western Prince Edward Island.[311]

        Other provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official.[312] There are 11 Indigenous language groups, composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects.[313] Several Indigenous languages have official status in the Northwest Territories.[314] Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut and is one of three official languages in the territory.[315]

        As of the 2021 census, just over 7.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their first language. Some of the most common non-official first languages include Mandarin (679,255 first-language speakers), Punjabi (666,585), Cantonese (553,380), Spanish (538,870), Arabic (508,410), Tagalog (461,150), Italian (319,505), German (272,865), and Tamil (237,890).[289] The country is also home to many sign languages, some of which are Indigenous.[316] American Sign Language (ASL) is used across the country due to the prevalence of ASL in primary and secondary schools.[317] Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) is used primarily in Quebec.[318]

        Religion
        Main article: Religion in Canada

        Freedom of religion sculpture by Marlene Hilton Moore at the McMurtry Gardens of Justice in Toronto[319]
        Canada is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and customs.[320] The Constitution of Canada refers to God; however, Canada has no official church and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism.[321] Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right.[322]

        Rates of religious adherence have steadily decreased since the 1970s.[320] With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life,[323] Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state.[324] Although the majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives,[325] they still believe in God.[326] The practice of religion is generally considered a private matter.[327]

        According to the 2021 census, Christianity is the largest religion in Canada, with Roman Catholics representing 29.9 percent of the population having the most adherents. Christians overall representing 53.3 percent of the population,[g] are followed by people reporting irreligion or having no religion at 34.6 percent.[330] Other faiths include Islam (4.9 percent), Hinduism (2.3 percent), Sikhism (2.1 percent), Buddhism (1.0 percent), Judaism (0.9 percent), and Indigenous spirituality (0.2 percent).[328] Canada has the second-largest national Sikh population, behind India.[331]

        Health
        Main article: Healthcare in Canada
        Healthcare in Canada is delivered through the provincial and territorial systems of publicly funded health care, informally called Medicare.[332] It is guided by the provisions of the Canada Health Act of 1984[333] and is universal.[334] Universal access to publicly funded health services "is often considered by Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national healthcare insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country".[335] Around 30 percent of Canadians' healthcare is paid for through the private sector.[336] This mostly pays for services not covered or partially covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry.[336] Approximately 65 to 75 percent of Canadians have some form of supplementary health insurance; many receive it through their employers or access secondary social service programs.[337]

        graph of expenditures as described in the caption
        Health expenditure and financing by country. Total health expenditure per capita in US dollars (PPP).
        In common with many other developed countries, Canada is experiencing an increase in healthcare expenditures due to a demographic shift toward an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2021, the average age in Canada was 41.9 years.[289] Life expectancy is 81.1 years.[338] A 2016 report by the chief public health officer found that 88 percent of Canadians, one of the highest proportions of the population among G7 countries, indicated that they "had good or very good health".[339] Eighty percent of Canadian adults self-report having at least one major risk factor for chronic disease: smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating or excessive alcohol use.[340] Canada has one of the highest rates of adult obesity among OECD countries, contributing to approximately 2.7 million cases of diabetes.[340] Four chronic diseases—cancer (leading cause of death), cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and diabetes—account for 65 percent of deaths in Canada.[341] There are approximately 8 million people aged 15 and older with one or more disabilities in Canada.[342]

        In 2024, the Canadian Institute for Health Information estimated that healthcare spending reached $372 billion, or 12.4 percent of Canada's GDP for that year.[343] In 2022, Canada's per-capita spending on health expenditures ranked 12th among health-care systems in the OECD.[344] Canada has performed close to, or above the average on the majority of OECD health indicators since the early 2000s, ranking above the average on OECD indicators for wait-times and access to care, with average scores for quality of care and use of resources.[345] The Commonwealth Fund's 2021 report comparing the healthcare systems of the 11 most developed countries ranked Canada second-to-last.[346] Identified weaknesses were comparatively higher infant mortality rate, the prevalence of chronic conditions, long wait times, poor availability of after-hours care, and a lack of prescription drugs and dental coverage.[346] An increasing problem in Canada's health system is a lack of healthcare professionals,[347] and hospital capacity.[348]

        Canada by province and territory, showing the percentage of the population aged 25 to 64 who had a bachelor's degree or higher, and the percentage point change from 2016 to 2021[349]
        Education in Canada is for the most part provided publicly, funded and overseen by federal, provincial, and local governments.[350] Education is within provincial jurisdiction and a province's curriculum is overseen by its government.[351] Education in Canada is generally divided into primary education, followed by secondary and post-secondary education. Education in both English and French is available in most places across Canada.[352] Canada has a large number of universities, almost all of which are publicly funded.[353] Established in 1663, Université Laval is the oldest post-secondary institution in Canada.[354] The nation's three top ranking universities are the University of Toronto, McGill, and the University of British Columbia.[355] The largest university is the University of Toronto, which has over 85,000 students.[356]

        According to a 2022 report by the OECD, Canada is one of the most educated countries in the world;[357] the country ranks first worldwide in the percentage of adults having tertiary education, with over 56 percent of Canadian adults having attained at least an undergraduate college or university degree.[358] Canada spends an average of 5.3 percent of its GDP on education.[359] The country invests heavily in tertiary education (more than US$20,000 per student).[360] As of 2022, 89 percent of adults aged 25 to 64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, compared to an OECD average of 75 percent.[361]

        Culture
        Main article: Culture of Canada
        Further information: Canadian values and Canadian identity

        Monument to Multiculturalism by Francesco Pirelli, in Toronto[362]
        Historically, Canada has been influenced by British, French, and Indigenous cultures and traditions.[363] During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean, and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture.[364]

        Canada's culture draws influences from its broad range of constituent nationalities, and policies that promote a just society are constitutionally protected.[365] Since the 1960s, Canada has emphasized human rights and inclusiveness for all its people.[366] Canadian identity shifted from primarily British-based to multicultural between the 1960s and 1970s.[367] The official state policy of multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments[368] and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity.[369] In Quebec, cultural identity is strong and there is a French Canadian culture that is distinct from English Canadian culture.[370] As a whole, Canada is in theory a cultural mosaic of regional ethnic subcultures with diverse areas and ethnic enclaves.[371]

        Canada's approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is based on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support.[372] Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control, a social liberal attitude toward women's rights (like pregnancy termination) and LGBT rights, and legalized euthanasia and cannabis use are indicators of Canada's political and cultural values.[373] Canadians also identify with the country's foreign aid policies, peacekeeping roles, the national park system, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[374]

        Symbols

        The mother beaver on the Canadian parliament's Peace Tower.[375] The five flowers on the shield each represent an ethnicity—Tudor rose: English; fleur de lis: French; thistle: Scottish; shamrock: Irish; and leek: Welsh.
        Themes of nature, pioneers, trappers, and traders played an important part in the early development of Canadian symbolism.[376] Modern symbols emphasize the country's geography, northern climate, lifestyles, and the Canadianization of traditional European and Indigenous symbols.[377] The use of the maple leaf as a symbol dates to the early 18th century in New France.[378] The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags and on the arms of Canada.[379] Canada's official tartan, known as the "maple leaf tartan", reflects the colours of the maple leaf through the seasons—green in the spring, gold in the early autumn, red at the first frost, and brown after falling.[380] The arms of Canada are closely modelled after those of the United Kingdom, with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version.[381]

        Other prominent symbols include the national motto, "A mari usque ad mare" ("from sea to sea"),[382] the sports of ice hockey and lacrosse, the beaver, Canada goose, common loon, Canadian horse, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rockies,[379] and, more recently, the Indigenous totem pole and Inuksuk.[383] Canadian cuisine items such as Canadian beer, maple syrup, Nanaimo bars, butter tarts, and the Quebec dishes of poutine and tourtière, alongside material items such as tuques, canoes and Hudson's Bay point blanket are considered as uniquely Canadian.[384] Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the coat of arms on the 50¢ piece, and the beaver on the nickel.[385] An image of the monarch appears on $20 bank notes and the obverse of coins.[385]

        Literature
        Main article: Canadian literature

        Author Margaret Atwood has suggested that during the 1970s Canadian literature was still looking for a national identity.[386]
        Canadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively.[387] The earliest Canadian narratives were of travel and exploration.[388] This developed into three major themes of historical Canadian literature: nature, frontier life, and Canada's position within the world, all of which tie into the garrison mentality.[389] The evolution of Canadian literature is intricately linked to the country's historical and social contexts, often mirroring the challenges and changes in Canadian society.[390] As Canadian literature progressed into the 20th and 21st centuries, it began to address a broader array of subjects and themes, such as women's rights, LGBTQ rights, immigrant experiences, environmental issues, the relationship with Indigenous peoples, and Canadian values and identity.[391]

        Financial support from governmental bodies, such as the Canada Council for the Arts and various provincial grant programs, facilitates the creation, publication, and promotion of works by Canadian authors.[392] Numerous Canadian authors have received international literary awards including the Nobel Prize in Literature, the Booker Prize, and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.[393] Canadian literary awards and prizes include the Governor General's Literary Awards, the Giller Prize, the Latner Griffin Writers' Trust Poetry Prize, the Burt Award for First Nations, Inuit and Métis Literature and several accolades for literature aimed at children.[394]

        Art in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by Indigenous peoples,[396] and, in later times, artists have combined British, French, Indigenous, and American artistic traditions, at times embracing European styles while working to promote nationalism.[397] The nature of Canadian art reflects these diverse origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality of their lives in Canada.[398] The Group of Seven is often considered the first uniquely Canadian artistic group and style of painting.[399] Inuit art since the 1950s has been the traditional gift given to foreign dignitaries by the Canadian government.[400]

        Historically, the Catholic Church was the primary patron of art in early Canada, especially Quebec.[401] The Government of Canada has played a role in the development of art, through the department of Canadian Heritage by giving grants to art galleries,[402] as well as by establishing and funding art schools and colleges across the country, and through the Canada Council for the Arts.[403] The Canada Council Art Bank also helps artists by buying and publicizing their work.[404] Great achievements in art in Canada are recognized through various awards and prizes, such as the Molson Prize, the Audain Prize for the Visual Arts, and the Governor General's Visual and Media Arts Awards.[405]

        Music
        Main article: Music of Canada

        Original publication of "O Canada" in English, 1908 (French, 1880)[406]
        Canadian music reflects a variety of regional scenes.[407] Canada has developed a vast music infrastructure that includes church halls, chamber halls, conservatories, academies, performing arts centres, record companies, radio stations, and television music video channels.[408] Government support programs, such as the Canada Music Fund, assist a wide range of musicians and entrepreneurs who create, produce and market original and diverse Canadian music.[409] As a result of its cultural importance, as well as government initiatives and regulations, the Canadian music industry is one of the largest in the world,[410] producing internationally renowned composers, musicians, and ensembles.[411] Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC.[412] The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada's music industry awards, the Juno Awards.[413] The Canadian Music Hall of Fame honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements.[414]

        "God Save the King" has been used in Canada since the late 1700s and is the country's de facto royal anthem.[415] Patriotic music by Canadians dates back over 200 years, with "The Bold Canadian", written in 1812, popular throughout the 19th century.[416] "The Maple Leaf Forever", written in 1866, was popular and served as an unofficial national anthem of English Canada.[417] "O Canada", originally composed in French in 1880, also served as an unofficial national anthem during the 20th century and was adopted as the country's official anthem in 1980.[418]

        Media
        Main article: Media of Canada

        A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) satellite truck, used for live television broadcasts
        Canada's media is highly autonomous, uncensored, diverse, and very regionalized.[419] The Broadcasting Act declares "the system should serve to safeguard, enrich, and strengthen the cultural, political, social, and economic fabric of Canada".[420] Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output—particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines—is often overshadowed by imports from the United States.[421] As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).[422]

        Canadian mass media, both print and digital, and in both official languages, is largely dominated by a "handful of corporations".[423] The largest of these corporations is the country's national public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which also plays a significant role in producing domestic cultural content, operating its own radio and TV networks in both English and French.[424] In addition to the CBC, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as TVOntario and Télé-Québec.[425]

        Non-news media content in Canada, including film and television, is influenced both by local creators as well as by imports from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France.[426] In an effort to reduce the amount of foreign-made media, government interventions in television broadcasting can include both regulation of content and public financing.[427] Canadian tax laws limit foreign competition in magazine advertising.[428]

        Sports
        Main article: Sports in Canada

        Our Game sculpture by Edie Parker outside the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto[429]
        Canada's official national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse.[430] Other major professional games include curling, basketball, baseball, soccer, and football.[431] Great achievements in Canadian sports are recognized by numerous "Halls of Fame" and museums, such as Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.[432]

        Canada shares several major professional sports leagues with the United States.[433] Canadian teams in these leagues include seven franchises in the National Hockey League, three Major League Soccer teams, and one team in each of Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. Other popular professional competitions include the Canadian Football League, National Lacrosse League, the Canadian Premier League, and the curling tournaments hosted by Curling Canada.[434] Canadians identified hockey as their preferred sport for viewing, followed by soccer and then basketball.[435]

        In terms of participation, swimming was the most commonly reported sport by over one-third (35 percent) of Canadians in 2023.[436] This was closely followed by cycling (33 percent) and running (27 percent).[436] The popularity of specific sports varies;[437] in general, the Canadian-born population was more likely to have participated in winter sports such as ice hockey (the most popular young adult team sport),[436] skating, skiing and snowboarding, compared with immigrants, who were more likely to have played soccer (the most popular youth team sport),[438] tennis or basketball.[436] Sports such as golf, volleyball, badminton, bowling, and martial arts are also widely enjoyed at the youth and amateur levels.[439]

        Canada has enjoyed success both at the Winter Olympics and at the Summer Olympics[440]—particularly the Winter Games as a "winter sports nation"—and has hosted high-profile international sporting events such as the 1976 Summer Olympics,[441] the 1988 Winter Olympics,[442] the 2010 Winter Olympics,[443] the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup,[444] the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games.[445] The country is scheduled to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Mexico and the United States.[446]

        All citizens of Canada are classified as "Canadians" as defined by Canada's nationality laws. "Canadian" as an ethnic group has since 1996 been added to census questionnaires for possible ancestral origin or descent. "Canadian" was included as an example on the English questionnaire and "Canadien" as an example on the French questionnaire.[294] "The majority of respondents to this selection are from the eastern part of the country that was first settled. Respondents generally are visibly European (Anglophones and Francophones) and no longer self-identify with their ethnic ancestral origins. This response is attributed to a multitude or generational distance from ancestral lineage."[295]

The theoretical foundation for these rights was the importance of free political speech and discussion in a democracy.

        <p>Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands.[N 6] It has a total area of 7,688,287 km2 (2,968,464 sq mi), making it the sixth-largest country in the world and the largest in Oceania. Australia is the world's flattest and driest inhabited continent.[17] It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates including deserts in the interior and tropical rainforests along the coast.

        The ancestors of Aboriginal Australians began arriving from Southeast Asia 50,000 to 65,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Period.[18][19][20] By the time of British settlement, Aboriginal Australians spoke more than 250 distinct languages and had one of the oldest living cultures in the world.[21] Australia's written history commenced with Dutch exploration of most of the coastline in the 17th century. British colonisation began in 1788 with the establishment of the penal colony of New South Wales. By the mid-19th century, most of the continent had been explored by European settlers and five additional self-governing British colonies were established, each gaining responsible government by 1890. The colonies federated in 1901, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. This continued a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942, and culminating in the Australia Acts of 1986.[22]

        Australia is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy, and a federation comprising six states and ten territories. Its population of almost 28 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard.[23] Canberra is the nation's capital, while its most populous cities are Sydney and Melbourne, both with a population of more than five million.[23] Australia's culture is diverse, and the country has one of the highest foreign-born populations in the world. It has a highly developed economy and one of the highest per capita incomes globally. Its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade relations are crucial to the country's economy. It ranks highly for quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, civil liberties and political rights.[24]

        Australia is a middle power, and has the world's thirteenth-highest military expenditure. It is a member of international groups including the United Nations; the G20; the OECD; the World Trade Organization; Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation; the Pacific Islands Forum; the Pacific Community; the Commonwealth of Nations; and the defence and security organisations ANZUS, AUKUS, and the Five Eyes. It is also a major non-NATO ally of the United States.[25]

        Etymology
        Main article: Name of Australia
        The name Australia (pronounced /əˈstreɪliə/ in Australian English)[26] is derived from the Latin Terra Australis Incognita ('unknown southern land'), a name used for a hypothetical continent in the Southern Hemisphere since ancient times.[27] Several 16th-century cartographers used the word Australia on maps, but not to identify modern Australia.[28]

        When the Dutch began visiting and mapping Australia in the 17th century, they called the continent New Holland. The name Australia was popularised by the explorer Matthew Flinders, who circumnavigated the continent in 1803. However, when his account of his voyage was published in 1814, the name Terra Australis was used.[27]

        New South Wales Governor Lachlan Macquarie officially recommended the name Australia to replace New Holland in December 1817. The British Admiralty adopted the name in 1824, and the British Parliament used it in legislation in 1828.[27] The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office used the new name in The Australia Directory of 1830.[29] The name "Commonwealth of Australia" for the new federation of the six former colonies was formalised in the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK).[27]

        Colloquial names for Australia include "Oz", "Straya" and "Down Under".[30]

        Aboriginal rock art in the Kimberley region of Western Australia
        Indigenous Australians comprise two broad groups:

        Aboriginal Australians, who are the various Indigenous peoples of the Australian mainland and many of its islands, including Tasmania
        Torres Strait Islanders, who are a distinct Melanesian people of Torres Strait Islands
        Human habitation of the Australian continent is estimated to have begun 50,000 to 65,000 years ago,[18][19][20] with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea crossings from what is now Southeast Asia.[18] It is uncertain how many waves of immigration may have contributed to these ancestors of modern Aboriginal Australians.[31][32] The Madjedbebe rock shelter in Arnhem Land is possibly the oldest site showing the presence of humans in Australia.[19][20][33] The oldest human remains found are the Lake Mungo remains, which have been dated to around 42,000 years ago.[34]

        Aboriginal Australian culture is one of the oldest continuous cultures on Earth.[35][36][37][31] At the time of first European contact, Aboriginal Australians belonged to wide range of societies, with diverse economies spread across at least 250 different language groups.[38][39][21] Estimates of the Aboriginal population before British settlement range from 300,000 to 3 million.[40] Aboriginal Australians cultures were (and remain) deeply connected with the land and the environment, with stories of The Dreaming maintained through oral tradition, songs, dance and paintings.[41] Certain groups engaged in fire-stick farming,[42][43] fish farming,[44][45] and built semi-permanent shelters.[46] These practices have variously been characterised as "hunter-gatherer", "agricultural", "natural cultivation" and "intensification".[41][47][48][49]

        Torres Strait Islander people first settled their islands at least 2,500 years ago.[50][51] Culturally and linguistically distinct from mainland Aboriginal peoples, they were seafarers and obtained their livelihood from seasonal horticulture and the resources of their reefs and seas. Agriculture also developed on some islands and villages appeared by the 1300s.[50] By the mid-18th century in northern Australia, contact, trade and cross-cultural engagement had been established between local Aboriginal groups and Makassan trepangers, visiting from present-day Indonesia.[52][53][54]

        European exploration and colonisation

        Landing of Lieutenant James Cook at Botany Bay, 29 April 1770
        Landing of James Cook at Botany Bay on 29 April 1770
        The Dutch East India Company ship, Duyfken, captained by Willem Janszoon, made the first documented European landing in Australia in 1606.[55] Later that year, Luís Vaz de Torres sailed to the north of Australia through Torres Strait, along New Guinea's southern coast.[56] Abel Tasman's voyage of 1642 was the first known European expedition to reach Van Diemen's Land. On his second voyage of 1644, he mapped the north coast of Australia south of New Guinea. Following Tasman's voyages, the Dutch were able to make almost complete maps of Australia's northern and western coasts and much of its southern and south-eastern Tasmanian coasts. They named the continent New Holland.[57]

        In 1770, Captain James Cook sailed along and mapped the east coast, which he named "New South Wales" and claimed for Great Britain.[58] in 1786, the British government announced its intention to establish a penal colony in New South Wales.[59] On 26 January 1788, the First Fleet commanded by Captain Arthur Phillip, arrived at Sydney Cove, Port Jackson. A camp was established and the Union Flag raised. The date later became Australia's national day.[60]

        Most early settlers were convicts, transported for petty crimes and assigned as labourers or servants to "free settlers" (willing immigrants). Once emancipated, convicts tended to integrate into colonial society. Aboriginal resistance, convict rebellions and bushranging were sometimes suppressed under martial law.[61][62] The 1808 Rum Rebellion, carried out by officers of the New South Wales Corp, led to a temporary military junta.[63] During the next two decades, social and economic reforms, together with the establishment of a Legislative Council and Supreme Court, saw the penal colony transition to a civil society.[64]

        The indigenous population declined for 150 years following European settlement, mainly due to infectious disease.[65] British colonial authorities did not sign any treaties with Aboriginal groups.[66][67] As settlement expanded, tens of thousands of Indigenous people and thousands of settlers were killed in frontier conflicts, which many historians argue included acts of genocide by settlers.[68][69] Settlers dispossessed surviving Indigenous peoples of most of their land.[68]

        Colonial expansion

        A calm body of water is in the foreground. The shoreline is about 200 metres away. To the left, close to the shore, are three tall gum trees; behind them on an incline are ruins, including walls and watchtowers of light-coloured stone and brick, what appear to be the foundations of walls, and grassed areas. To the right lie the outer walls of a large rectangular four-storey building dotted with regularly spaced windows. Forested land rises gently to a peak several kilometres back from the shore.
        Tasmania's Port Arthur penal settlement is one of eleven UNESCO World Heritage-listed Australian Convict Sites.
        In 1803, a settlement was established in Van Diemen's Land (present-day Tasmania),[70] and in 1813, Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth crossed the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, opening the interior to European settlement.[71] The British claim was extended to the whole Australian continent in 1827 when Major Edmund Lockyer established a settlement on King George Sound (modern-day Albany).[72] The Swan River Colony (present-day Perth) was established in 1829, evolving into the largest Australian colony by area, Western Australia.[73] Separate colonies were carved from New South Wales: Tasmania in 1825, South Australia in 1836, Victoria in 1851, and Queensland in 1859.[74] South Australia and Victoria were founded as free colonies—they never accepted transported convicts.[75] Growing opposition to the convict system culminated in its abolition in the eastern colonies by the 1850s. Initially a free colony, Western Australia accepted convicts from 1850 to 1868.[76]

        The six colonies individually gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890, managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the British Empire.[77] The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs.[78] The colonial parliaments progressively extended voting rights to adult men from 1856, with women's suffrage on equal terms following between the 1890s and 1900s. Some colonies introduced racial restrictions on voting from 1885.[79]

        In the mid-19th century, explorers such as Burke and Wills charted Australia's interior.[80] A series of gold rushes beginning in the early 1850s led to an influx of new migrants from China, North America and continental Europe,[81] as well as outbreaks of bushranging and civil unrest; the latter peaked in 1854 when Ballarat miners launched the Eureka Rebellion against gold licence fees.[82] The 1860s saw the rise of blackbirding, where South Sea Islanders were coerced or abducted into indentured labour, mainly by Queensland colonists.[83][84]

        From 1886, Australian colonial governments began removing many Aboriginal children from their families and communities, justified on the grounds of child protection and forced assimilation policies.[85][86][87] The Second Boer War (1899–1902) marked the largest overseas deployment of Australia's colonial forces.[88][89]

        Federation to the World Wars
        Main article: History of Australia (1901–1945)
        See also: Federation of Australia, Military history of Australia during World War I, and Military history of Australia during World War II

        The Big Picture, a painting by Tom Roberts, depicts the opening of the first Australian Parliament in 1901.
        On 1 January 1901, federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning, constitutional conventions and referendums, resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia as a nation under the new Australian Constitution.[90]

        From 1901, Australia was a self-governing dominion within the British Empire.[91] It was one of the founding members of the League of Nations in 1920,[92] and the United Nations in 1945.[93] The Statute of Westminster 1931 ended the ability of the UK to legislate for Australia at the federal level without Australia's consent. Australia adopted it in 1942, but it was backdated to 1939 to confirm the validity of legislation passed during World War II.[94]

        The Australian Capital Territory was formed in 1911 as the location for the future federal capital of Canberra. While it was being constructed, Melbourne served as the temporary capital from 1901 to 1927.[95] The Northern Territory was transferred from the control of South Australia to the Commonwealth in 1911.[96] Australia took over the administration of the Territory of Papua (which had previously been a British colony) in 1905 and of the Territory of New Guinea (formerly German New Guinea) in 1920. The two were unified as the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in 1949 and gained independence from Australia in 1975.[97]


        The 1942 Bombing of Darwin, the first of more than 100 Japanese air raids on Australia during World War II
        In 1914, Australia joined the Allies in the First World War, and took part in the fighting on several fronts.[98] Of the 324,000 men who served overseas, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were wounded.[99] Many Australians regard the defeat of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) at Gallipoli in 1915 as the "baptism of fire" that forged the new nation's identity.[100][101] The beginning of the campaign is commemorated annually on Anzac Day, a date which rivals Australia Day as the nation's most important.[100][102]

        From 1939 to 1945, Australia joined the Allies in fighting the Second World War. Australia's armed forces fought in the Pacific, European and Mediterranean and Middle East theatres.[103] The shock of Britain's defeat in Singapore in 1942, followed soon after by the bombing of Darwin and other Japanese attacks on Australian soil, led to a widespread belief in Australia that a Japanese invasion was imminent, and a shift from the United Kingdom to the United States as Australia's principal ally and security partner.[104] Since 1951, Australia has been allied with the United States under the ANZUS treaty.[105]

        Postwar migrants from Europe arriving in Australia in 1954
        In the three decades following World War II, Australia experienced significant increases in living standards, leisure time and suburban development.[106] Governments encouraged a large wave of immigration from across Europe and called these migrants "New Australians". High immigration was justified to Australians using the slogan "populate or perish,"[107] and from the 1960s the white Australia policy was gradually relaxed.[108]

        A member of the Western Bloc during the Cold War, Australia participated in the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency during the 1950s and the Vietnam War from 1962 to 1973.[109][110] Tensions over communist influence in society led to unsuccessful attempts by the Menzies Government to ban the Communist Party of Australia, and a bitter split in the Labor Party in 1955.[111]

        As a result of a 1967 referendum, the federal government gained the power to legislate with regard to Aboriginal Australians, and Aboriginal Australians were fully included in the census.[112] Pre-colonial land interests (referred to as native title in Australia) was recognised in law for the first time when the High Court of Australia held in Mabo v Queensland (No 2) that Australia was not terra nullius ('land belonging to no one') at the time of European settlement.[113][114][115]

        Following the abolition of the last vestiges of the White Australia policy in 1973,[116] Australia's demography and culture transformed as a result of a large and ongoing wave of non-European immigration, mostly from Asia.[117] The late 20th century also saw an increasing focus on foreign policy ties with other Asia–Pacific nations.[118] The Australia Acts of 1986 severed the remaining constitutional ties between Australia and the United Kingdom while maintaining the monarch in her independent capacity as Queen of Australia.[119][120] In a 1999 constitutional referendum, 55% of voters rejected abolishing the monarchy and becoming a republic.[121]

        Following the September 11 attacks on the United States, Australia joined the United States in fighting the Afghanistan War from 2001 to 2021 and the Iraq War from 2003 to 2009.[122] The nation's trade relations also became increasingly oriented towards East Asia in the 21st century, with China becoming the nation's largest trading partner by a large margin.[123]

        In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, from March 2020 lockdowns and other restrictions on public gatherings and movement across the national and state borders were implemented by the Federal, state and territory governments. Following the rollout of vaccines in 2021, these restrictions were gradually eased. In October 2023, Australia declared that COVID-19 was no longer a communicable disease incident of national significance.[124]

        Topographic map of Australia (Dark green represents the lowest elevation and dark brown the highest.)
        Australia consists of the mainland Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, numerous smaller offshore islands, and the remote offshore territories of Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Coral Sea Islands, Heard and McDonald Islands, and Norfolk Island.[125] Australia also claims about 42% of Antarctica as the Australian Antarctic Territory, but this claim is only recognised by four other countries.[16]

        Mainland Australia lies between latitudes 9° and 44° south, and longitudes 112° and 154° east.[8] Surrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans, Australia is separated from Asia by the Arafura and Timor seas, with the Coral Sea lying off the Queensland coast, and the Tasman Sea lying between Australia and New Zealand. The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest coral reef, lies a short distance off the north-east coast and extends for more than 2,300 km (1,400 mi).[126]

        The mainland is the world's smallest continent and the country is the sixth-largest by total area.[127] Australia is sometimes considered the world's largest island[128] and is often dubbed the "island continent".[129] It has 35,877 km (22,293 mi) of coastline (excluding all offshore islands),[127] and claims an exclusive economic zone of 8,148,250 square kilometres (3,146,060 sq mi). This exclusive economic zone does not include the Australian Antarctic Territory.[130]


        Fitzroy Island, one of the 600 islands within the main archipelago of the Great Barrier Reef
        Most of Australia is arid or semi-arid.[131] In 2021, Australia had 10% of the global permanent meadows and pastureland.[132] Forest cover is around 17% of Australia's land area.[133][134] The Australian mainland is relatively flat, with an average height of 325 metres (1,066 ft) compared with 870 metres (2,850 ft) for all continents.[135] The Great Dividing Range runs along most of eastern Australia, dividing the central lowlands from the eastern highlands.[136] At 2,228 m (7,310 ft), Mount Kosciuszko is the highest mountain on the mainland. Taller are Mawson Peak, at 2,745 m (9,006 ft), on Heard Island, and, in the Australian Antarctic Territory, Mount McClintock and Mount Menzies, at 3,492 m (11,457 ft) and 3,355 m (11,007 ft) respectively.[136]


        Uluru in the semi-arid region of Central Australia
        The Murray-Darling is the major river system, draining most of inland New South Wales and Southern Queensland towards Lake Alexandrina and the sea in South Australia. There are also smaller coastal river systems, inland drainage systems such as the Lake Eyre system, and salt lake systems in central and western Australia.[137] Australia's rivers have the lowest discharge into the sea of any continent. The mainland's flat, arid profile also makes its rivers slow-moving, resulting in a build up of salt on the land.[138] Salinisation adversely affects Australia's soil which is, on average, poor in nutrients compared with world standards.[139]

        Australia's population is concentrated on the coastal fringes. About 95% of the population lives within 100 km of the coast; the world average is 39%.[140] Australia's population density is 3.5 inhabitants per square kilometre,[23] which is one of the lowest in the world.[140] However, there is a large concentration of the population in cities along the temperate south-eastern coastline, and population density exceeds 38 inhabitants per square kilometre in central Melbourne.[23]

        Geology
        Main article: Geology of Australia

        Basic geological regions of Australia (by age)
        Formerly part of the Rodinia and Gondwana supercontinents,[141] Australia completely separated from Antarctica about 35 million years ago and continued drifting northwards.[142] When the Last Glacial Period ended, rising sea levels separated the Australian mainland from New Guinea about 8,000 years ago and from Tasmania about 6,000 years ago.[142]

        Australia lies well within the Australian tectonic plate. The mainland is relatively stable geologically, with no major mountain building, active volcanoes or tectonic faults.[143] However, the Australian plate is moving north-northeast at a rate of about 6 to 7 cm a year and is currently in collision with the Eurasian plate and Pacific plate.[144] The resulting intratectonic stresses lead to relatively high seismic activity for a geologically stable landmass. There were 18 earthquakes with a moment magnitude of greater than 6 between 1901 and 2017.[144] The Newcastle earthquake of 1989 was Australia's deadliest, killing 13 people.[145] There were active volcanoes on the eastern mainland as recently as 4,600 years ago,[146] and this is reflected in Aboriginal place names and creation stories.[147] Currently, volcanism occurs in the remote Heard Island and McDonald Islands.[148]

        The Australian continental crust was created in three cycles from the oldest Archaean cratons in the west to the younger orogenic formations in the east (built about 541 million to 252 million years ago).[146][149] The oldest Australian surface rocks date to the Archaean period. Some in Western Australia are older than 3.7 billion years and others in South Australia are over 3.1 billion years old. The oldest zircon crystals on Earth, dating back 4.4 billion years, have been found in Western Australia. However, about 80 per cent of Australia is covered by sedimentary rocks and regolith that are less than 250 million years old.[146]

        Climate
        Main article: Climate of Australia

        Köppen climate types of Australia[150]
        The Australian climate ranges from wet tropical in the northeast and northwest to arid in the centre. The coastal south is temperate and humid with winter freezing and snow in the southeastern highlands and Tasmania. The climate is influenced by Australia's position in the "horse latitudes", which tends to bring arid conditions.[151] Overall, the Australian mainland is the driest inhabited continent, with an average annual rainfall of 470 millimetres (19 in).[131] About 70% of the country is arid or semi-arid,[131] and about 18% is desert.[152]

        The climate is also influenced by various systems such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole and the Southern Annular Mode.[153] Australia has unusual variability in rainfall within years and between years, leading to frequent droughts and flooding. Cyclones and rain depressions are common in tropical Australia. The summer monsoon brings significant rainfall to northern Australia and low pressure cells bring winter rainfall in the south. The hottest regions are in the northwest of the country and the coolest in the southeast. Bushfire conditions are common in southern Australia.[151]

        Climate change from increased greenhouse gas emissions has led to a 1.5 °C rise in Australian temperatures since 1910 and an increase in extreme heat and heavy rainfall events. There has been a reduction in rainfall from April to October in southern Australia since 1970 and a longer bushfire season since the 1950s. Rainfall has increased in northern Australia since the 1970s. The number of tropical cyclones has fallen since 1982 and alpine snow has decreased since the late 1950s. Sea levels are rising around Australia and the surrounding oceans are becoming more acidic.[153]

        Biodiversity
        See also: Fauna of Australia, Flora of Australia, and Fungi of Australia

        Koala and Eucalyptus
        Australia is one of 17 megadiverse countries.[154] Because of its long geographic isolation, much of Australia's biota is unique.[155] About 94% of its amphibians, 93% of its reptiles and flowering plants, 69% of its mammals and 46% of its birds are endemic.[156] Australia has a wide range of ecosystems of which 89 regions and 419 subregions are recognised in the Australian bioregion framework.[157][158]

        In January 2025, there were 168,386 named species on the Australian National Species List.[159] However, it is estimated that 70% of Australian species have not been discovered and classified and that there may be 600,000 Australian native species. In general, knowledge of vertebrates and flowering plants is better than for invertebrates and fungi. It is estimated that less that 10% of Australia's fungi and insects have been named.[160]

        About 10% of the world's known plant species are found in Australia.[161] Many of these have adapted to the arid climate, variable rainfall and nutrient-poor soil. Deserts and xeric shrubland cover about 70% of the mainland. Acacia, banksia and eucalypts have spread over much of Australia. Many plants have hard and long-living leaves, and are rich in carbon, poor in nutrients, and well adapted to bushfires.[162]

        About two-thirds of the world's 330 species of marsupials are native to Australia.[163] Australian placental mammals (overwhelmingly bats, rats and mice) also make up almost 47% of the world's land mammal species.[164] Australia has about 10% of the world's known reptile species.[165] There are also about 320,500 invertebrate species, of which insects are the largest class, accounting for more than 75% of all animal species.[166] Australia has over 15,000 known species of fungi, although it is possible that tens of thousands more exist.[167]

        Australia's wildlife show many adaptations to their environments. As the leaves of most plants are poor in nutrients, Australia has a high proportion of birds, insects and marsupials, such as the honey possum, that feed on nectar and pollen. The koala is an exception, specialising in feeding on eucalyptus leaves.[168][169] Nutritionally poor flora and variable rainfall also favour animals with lower energy requirements, including snakes, lizards, and hopping marsupials such as the kangaroo and wallaby. There is, however, evidence of convergent evolution of Australia's marsupials and the placental mammals of other continents living in similar environments. For example, the extinct thylacine (Tasmanian tiger) had similarities with the placental wolf, marsupial moles with the golden moles of Africa, and hopping mice with the hopping rodents of other arid regions.[169]

        There were major extinctions of Australia's vertebrates, including its megafauna, around 46 thousand years ago, and there is an ongoing scientific debate over the role of human activity and climate change in these extinctions. The contraction of the range of the Tasmanian tiger and Tasmanian devil to that island around 4,000 to 5,000 years ago is also consistent with changes on the mainland including an increasing human population, the introduction of the dingo, and the greater use of fire and new stone tool technologies.[170][171]

        Over the past two centuries, Australia has lost more mammal species than any other continent. Overall, 100 Australian species are listed as extinct or extinct in the wild. In June 2021, over 1,000 animal and plant species were listed by Australian governments as endangered or critically endangered.[172] The major threats to endangered species are landscape change, ecosystem disruption, introduced species such as the feral cat and red fox, and climate change.[173]

        The federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 is the legal framework for the protection of threatened species.[174] The National Reserve System is Australia's network of protected areas. As at 30 June 2022, it covered over 22% of Australia's land mass.[175] Australia's Strategy for Nature 2024–2030 is the national biodiversity plan that aims to reverse biodiversity loss in Australia by 2030 and meet the county's obligations under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and other international agreements.[176][177]

        King of Australia

        Governor-General

        Anthony Albanese,
        Prime Minister
        Australia is a constitutional monarchy, a parliamentary democracy and a federation.[178] The country has maintained its mostly unchanged constitution alongside a stable liberal democratic political system since Federation in 1901. It is one of the world's oldest federations, in which power is divided between the federal and state governments. The Australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the United Kingdom (a fused executive, constitutional monarchy and strong party discipline) and the United States (federalism, a written constitution and strong bicameralism with a Senate in which states have equal representation), resulting in a distinct hybrid.[179][180]

        Federal government power is partially separated between three groups:[181]

        Legislature: the bicameral Parliament, comprising the monarch, the Senate, and the House of Representatives
        Executive: the Australian Government, led by the prime minister (the leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the House of Representatives), their chosen Cabinet and other ministers; formally appointed by the governor-general[182]
        Judiciary: the High Court and other federal courts
        Following elections on 3 May 2025, the prime minister is Anthony Albanese of the Australian Labor Party.[183] Charles III reigns as King of Australia and is represented in Australia by the governor-general at the federal level and by the governors at the state level, who by section 63 of the Constitution and convention act on the advice of their ministers.[184][185] Thus, in practice the governor-general acts as a legal figurehead for the actions of the prime minister and the Cabinet. The governor-general may in some situations exercise reserve powers: powers exercisable in the absence of, or contrary to, ministerial advice. When these powers may be exercised is governed by convention and their precise scope is unclear. The most notable exercise of these powers was the dismissal of the Whitlam government in the constitutional crisis of 1975.[186]

        Parliament House, Canberra
        In the Senate (the upper house), there are 76 senators: twelve each from the states and two each from the mainland territories (the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory).[187] The House of Representatives (the lower house) has 150 members elected from single-member electoral divisions, commonly known as "electorates" or "seats", allocated to states on the basis of population, with each of the current states guaranteed a minimum of five seats.[188] The lower house has a maximum term of three years, but this is not fixed and governments usually dissolve the house early for an election at some point in the 6 months before the maximum.[189] Elections for both chambers are generally held simultaneously with senators having overlapping six-year terms except for those from the territories, whose terms are not fixed but are tied to the electoral cycle for the lower house. Thus, only 40 of the 76 places in the Senate are put to each election unless the cycle is interrupted by a double dissolution.[187]

        Australia's electoral system uses preferential voting for the House of Representatives and all state and territory lower house elections (with the exception of Tasmania and the ACT which use the Hare-Clark system). The Senate and most state upper houses use the proportional system which combines preferential voting with proportional representation for each state. Voting and enrolment is compulsory for all enrolled citizens 18 years and older in every jurisdiction.[190][191][192] The party with majority support in the House of Representatives forms the government and its leader becomes prime minister. The governor-general appoints the prime minister and may dismiss one who has lost the confidence of parliament or acts illegally.[193] As Australia is a Westminster parliamentary democracy with a powerful and elected upper house, its system has sometimes been called a "Washminster mutation",[179] or semi-parliamentary.[194]

        There are two major political groups that have usually formed government federally: the Australian Labor Party and the Coalition which is a grouping of the Liberal Party and its minor partner, the National Party.[195][196] At the state level of government, the relationship between the Nationals and the Liberal Party differs, with the parties merged in Queensland and the Northern Territory (federal parliamentarians, however, sit in either the Liberal or National party room); in coalition in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia; and in competition with the Liberals in South Australia and Tasmania.[197] Within Australian political culture, the Labor Party is considered centre-left and the Coalition is considered centre-right.[198] Independent members and several minor parties have achieved representation in Australian parliaments, mostly in upper houses. The Australian Greens are the third largest party by both vote and membership.[199][200][when?]

        States and territories
        Main article: States and territories of Australia

        Australia's states and territories
        Australia has six states—New South Wales (NSW), Victoria (Vic), Queensland (Qld), Western Australia (WA), South Australia (SA) and Tasmania (Tas)—and two mainland self-governing territories—the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory (NT).[201]

        The states have the general power to make laws except in the few areas where the constitution grants the Commonwealth (the federal level of government) exclusive powers.[202][203] The Commonwealth can only make laws on topics listed in the constitution but its laws prevail over those of the states to the extent of any inconsistency.[204][205] Since Federation, the Commonwealth's power relative to the states has significantly increased due to the increasingly wide interpretation given to listed Commonwealth powers – and because of the states' heavy financial reliance on Commonwealth grants.[206][207]

        Each state and major mainland territory has its own parliament—unicameral in the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the other states. The lower houses are known as the Legislative Assembly (the House of Assembly in South Australia and Tasmania); the upper houses are known as the Legislative Council. The head of the government in each state is the premier and in each territory the chief minister. The King is represented in each state by a governor. At the Commonwealth level, the King's representative is the governor-general.[185]

        The Commonwealth government directly administers the internal Jervis Bay Territory and the external territories: the Ashmore and Cartier Islands, the Coral Sea Islands, the Heard Island and McDonald Islands, the Indian Ocean territories (Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands), Norfolk Island,[210] and the Australian Antarctic Territory.[211][212][182] The remote Macquarie Island and Lord Howe Island are part of Tasmania and New South Wales respectively.[213][214]

        Foreign relations
        Main article: Foreign relations of Australia

        Diplomatic missions of Australia
        Australia is a middle power,[215] whose foreign relations has three core bi-partisan pillars: commitment to the US alliance, engagement with the Indo-Pacific and support for international institutions, rules and co-operation.[216][217][218] Through the ANZUS pact and its status as a major non-NATO ally, Australia maintains a close relationship with the US, which encompasses strong defence, security and trade ties.[219][220] In the Indo-Pacific, the country seeks to increase its trade ties through the open flow of trade and capital, while managing the rise of Chinese power by supporting the existing rules-based order.[217] Regionally, the country is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Community, the ASEAN+6 mechanism and the East Asia Summit. Internationally, the country is a member of the United Nations (of which it was a founding member), the Commonwealth of Nations, the OECD and the G20. This reflects the country's generally strong commitment to multilateralism.[221][222]

        Australia is a member of several defence, intelligence and security groupings including the Five Eyes intelligence alliance with the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand; the ANZUS alliance with the United States and New Zealand; the AUKUS security treaty with the United States and United Kingdom; the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with the United States, India and Japan; the Five Power Defence Arrangements with New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and Singapore; and the Reciprocal Access defence and security agreement with Japan.[223][224][225]


        Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese with American President Joe Biden in 2022
        Australia has pursued the cause of international trade liberalisation.[226] It led the formation of the Cairns Group and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation,[227][228] and is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).[229][230] Beginning in the 2000s, Australia entered into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership multilateral free trade agreements as well as bilateral free trade agreements with the United States, China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, with the most recent deal signed in 2023 with the UK.[231]

        Australia maintains a deeply integrated relationship with neighbouring New Zealand, with free mobility of citizens between the two countries under the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement and free trade under the Closer Economic Relations agreement.[232] The most favourably viewed countries by the Australian people in 2021 include New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and South Korea.[233] It also maintains an international aid program under which some 75 countries receive assistance.[234] Australia ranked fourth in the Center for Global Development's 2021 Commitment to Development Index.[235]

        The power over foreign policy is highly concentrated in the prime minister and the national security committee, with major decision such as joining the 2003 invasion of Iraq made without prior Cabinet approval.[236][237] Similarly, the Parliament does not play a formal role in foreign policy and the power to declare war lies solely with the executive government.[238] The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade supports the executive in its policy decisions.[239]

        Military
        Main article: Australian Defence Force

        The two main institutions involved in the management of Australia's armed forces are the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the Department of Defence, together known as "Defence".[240] The Australian Defence Force is the military wing, headed by the chief of the defence force, and contains three branches: the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force. In 2021, it had 84,865 currently serving personnel (including 60,286 regulars and 24,581 reservists).[241] The Department of Defence is the civilian wing and is headed by the secretary of defence. These two leaders collective manage Defence as a diarchy, with shared and joint responsibilities.[242] The titular role of commander-in-chief is held by the governor-general; however, actual command is vested in the chief of the Defence Force.[243] The executive branch of the Commonwealth government has overall control of the military through the minister of defence, who is subject to the decisions of Cabinet and its National Security Committee.[244] Major Australian intelligence agencies include the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (foreign intelligence), the Australian Signals Directorate (signals intelligence) and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (domestic security).

        In 2022, defence spending was 1.9% of GDP, representing the world's 13th-largest defence budget.[245] In 2024, the ADF had active operations in the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific (including security and aid provisions); was contributing to UN forces in relation to South Sudan, Syria–Israel peacekeeping, and North Korea; and domestically was assisting in natural disaster relief and assisting in preventing asylum-seekers from entering the country.[246]

        Human rights
        See also: Human rights in Australia
        Australia has generally strong protections for civil and political rights, and the country has signed up to a wide range of international rights treaties.[247] Important documents protecting human rights include the Constitution, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, and the Age Discrimination Act 2004.[248] Same-sex marriage has been legal in the nation since 2017.[249][250] Unlike other comparable Western democracies, Australia does not have a single federal charter of rights in the Constitution or under legislation; however, the ACT, Victoria, and Queensland have state-based ones.[251]

        International organisations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have expressed concerns in areas including asylum-seeker policy, Indigenous deaths in custody, the lack of entrenched rights protection, and laws restricting protesting.[252][253]

        Economy

        The central business district of Sydney is the financial centre of Australia.
        Australia's mixed-market economy is highly developed and rich in natural resources.[254] It is the world's fourteenth-largest by nominal terms, and the 18th-largest by PPP. As of 2021, Australia has the second-highest amount of wealth per adult, after Luxembourg,[255] and the thirteenth-highest financial assets per capita,[256] as well as one of the highest per capita incomes globally.[257] It has a labour force of some 13.5 million, with an unemployment rate of 3.5% as of June 2022.[258] According to the Australian Council of Social Service, the poverty rate of Australia exceeds 13.6% of the population, encompassing over 3.2 million.[259] It also estimated that there were 774,000 (17.7%) children under the age of 15 living in relative poverty.[260] The Australian dollar is the national currency, which is also used by three island states in the Pacific: Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu.[261]

        Australian government debt, about $963 billion in June 2022, exceeds 45.1% of the country's total GDP, and is the world's eighth-highest.[262] Australia had the second-highest level of household debt in the world in 2020, after Switzerland.[263] Its house prices are among the highest in the world, especially in the large urban areas.[264] The large service sector accounts for about 71.2% of total GDP, followed by the industrial sector (25.3%), while its agriculture sector makes up 3.6% of total GDP.[265] Australia is the world's 21st-largest exporter[266] and 24th-largest importer.[267] China is Australia's largest trading partner, accounting for roughly 40% of the country's exports and 17.6% of its imports.[268] Other major export markets include Japan, the United States, and South Korea.[269]

        Australia has high levels of competitiveness and economic freedom, and was ranked tenth in the Human Development Index in 2022.[270] As of 2022, it is ranked twelfth in the Index of Economic Freedom.[271] It attracted 9.5 million international tourists in 2019,[272] and was ranked thirteenth among the countries of Asia-Pacific in 2019 for inbound tourism.[273] The 2021 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report ranked Australia seventh-highest in the world out of 117 countries.[274] Its international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to $45.7 billion.[273]

        Energy
        Main articles: Energy policy of Australia and Renewable energy in Australia
        In 2021–22, Australia's generation of electricity was sourced from black coal (37.2%), brown coal (12%), natural gas (18.8%), hydro (6.5%), wind (11.1%), solar (13.3%), bio-energy (1.2%) and others (1.7%).[275][276] Total consumption of energy in this period was sourced from coal (28.4%), oil (37.3%), gas (27.4%) and renewables (7%).[277] From 2012 to 2022, the energy sourced from renewables has increased 5.7%, while energy sourced from coal has decreased 2.6%. The use of gas also increased by 1.5% and the use of oil stayed relatively stable with a reduction of only 0.2%.[278]

        In 2020, Australia produced 27.7% of its electricity from renewable sources,[279] exceeding the target set by the Commonwealth government in 2009 of 20% renewable energy by 2020.[280] A new target of 82% per cent renewable energy by 2030 was set in 2022[281] and a target for net zero emissions by 2050 was set in 2021.[282]

        Science and technology
        In 2019, Australia spent $35.6 billion on research and development, allocating about 1.79% of GDP.[283] A 2022 study by the industry lobby group, The Tech Council of Australia, stated that the Australian technology sector combined contributes $167 billion a year to the economy and employs 861,000 people.[284] In 2022, startup ecosystems in Sydney and Melbourne were valued at $34 billion.[285] Australia ranked 22nd in the Global Innovation Index 2025.[286][287]

        With only 0.3% of the world's population, Australia contributed over 4% of the world's published research in 2020,[288] making it one of the top 10 research contributors in the world.[289] CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, contributes 10% of all research in the country, while the rest is carried out by universities.[288] Australian achievements include the invention of atomic absorption spectroscopy,[290] the essential components of Wi-Fi technology,[291] and the development of the first commercially successful polymer banknote.[292] As of 2024, 13 Australian scientists have been awarded the Nobel Prize in physics, chemistry or medicine,[293] and two have been awarded the Fields Medal.[294]

        Facilities supporting space exploration include the Square Kilometre Array and Australia Telescope Compact Array radio telescopes, telescopes such as the Siding Spring Observatory, and ground stations such as the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex.[295]

        Demographics
        Main article: Demographics of Australia
        The population of Australia is estimated to be 28,102,800 as of 23 October 2025.[10] It is the 54th[296] most populous country in the world and the most populous Oceanian country.

        Australia has a population density of 3.4 persons per square kilometre of total land area, which makes it one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. The population is heavily concentrated on the east coast, and in particular in the south-eastern region between South East Queensland to the north-east and Adelaide to the south-west.[23]

        Australia is also highly urbanised, with 67% of the population living in the Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (metropolitan areas of the state and mainland territorial capital cities) in 2018.[297] Metropolitan areas with more than one million inhabitants are Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide.[23]

        In common with many other developed countries, Australia is experiencing a demographic shift towards an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2021, the average age of the population was 39 years.[298]

        Cities

        Ancestry and immigration
        Main article: Immigration to Australia

        Australian residents by country of birth (2021 census)
        Between 1788 and the Second World War, the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from the British Isles (principally England, Ireland and Scotland), although there was significant immigration from China and Germany during the 19th century. Following Federation in 1901, the white Australia policy was strengthened, restricting further migration from these areas. However, this policy was relaxed following WW2, and in the decades following, Australia received a large wave of immigration from across Europe, with many more immigrants arriving from Southern and Eastern Europe than in previous decades. All overt racial discrimination ended in 1973, with multiculturalism becoming official policy.[301] Subsequently, there has been a large and continuing wave of immigration from across the world, with Asia being the largest source of immigrants in the 21st century.[302]

        Today, Australia has the world's eighth-largest immigrant population, with immigrants accounting for 30% of the population, the highest proportion among major Western nations.[303][304] In 2022–23, 212,789 permanent migrants were admitted to Australia, with a net migration population gain of 518,000 people inclusive of non-permanent residents.[305][306] Most entered on skilled visas,[302] however the immigration program also offers visas for family members and refugees.[307]

        The Australian Bureau of Statistics asks each Australian resident to nominate up to two ancestries each census and the responses are classified into broad ancestry groups.[308][309] At the 2021 census, the most commonly nominated ancestry groups as a proportion of the total population were:[310] 57.2% European (including 46% North-West European and 11.2% Southern and Eastern European), 33.8% Oceanian,[N 7] 17.4% Asian (including 6.5% Southern and Central Asian, 6.4% North-East Asian, and 4.5% South-East Asian), 3.2% North African and Middle Eastern, 1.4% Peoples of the Americas, and 1.3% Sub-Saharan African. At the 2021 census, the most commonly nominated individual ancestries as a proportion of the total population were:[N 8][4]

        English (33%)
        Australian (29.9%)[N 9]
        Irish (9.5%)
        Scottish (8.6%)
        Chinese (5.5%)
        Italian (4.4%)
        German (4%)
        Indian (3.1%)
        Aboriginal (2.9%)[N 10]
        Greek (1.7%)
        Filipino (1.6%)
        Dutch (1.5%)
        Vietnamese (1.3%)
        Lebanese (1%)
        At the 2021 census, 3.8% of the Australian population identified as being Indigenous—Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders.[N 11][309]

        Language
        Main article: Languages of Australia
        Although English is not the official language of Australia in law, it is the de facto official and national language.[312][313] Australian English is a major variety of the language with a distinctive accent and lexicon,[314] and differs slightly from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling.[315] General Australian serves as the standard dialect.[316] The Australian sign language known as Auslan was used at home by 16,242 people at the time of the 2021 census.[317]

        At the 2021 census, English was the only language spoken in the home for 72% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home were Mandarin (2.7%), Arabic (1.4%), Vietnamese (1.3%), Cantonese (1.2%) and Punjabi (0.9%).[318]

        More than 250 Australian Aboriginal languages are thought to have existed at the time of first European contact.[319] The National Indigenous Languages Survey (NILS) for 2018–19 found that more than 120 Indigenous language varieties were in use or being revived, although 70 of those in use were endangered.[320] The 2021 census found that 167 Indigenous languages were spoken at home by 76,978 Indigenous Australians — Yumplatok (Torres Strait Creole), Djambarrpuyngu (a Yolŋu language) and Pitjantjatjara (a Western Desert language) were among the most widely spoken.[321] NILS and the Australian Bureau of Statistics use different classifications for Indigenous Australian languages.[322]

        Religion
        Main article: Religion in Australia

        St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney belongs to the Catholic Church, Australia's largest religious denomination.
        Australia has no state religion; section 116 of the Australian Constitution prohibits federal legislation that would establish any religion, impose any religious observance, or prohibit the free exercise of any religion.[323] However, the states still retain the power to pass religiously discriminatory laws.[324]

        At the 2021 census, 38.9% of the population identified as having no religion,[4] up from 15.5% in 2001.[325] The largest religion is Christianity (43.9% of the population).[4] The largest Christian denominations are the Catholic Church (20% of the population) and the Anglican Church of Australia (9.8%). Non-British immigration since the Second World War has led to the growth of non-Christian religions, the largest of which are Islam (3.2%), Hinduism (2.7%), Buddhism (2.4%), Sikhism (0.8%), and Judaism (0.4%).[326][4]

        In 2021, just under 8,000 people declared an affiliation with traditional Aboriginal religions.[4] In Australian Aboriginal mythology and the animist framework developed in Aboriginal Australia, the Dreaming is a sacred era in which ancestral totemic spirit beings formed The Creation. The Dreaming established the laws and structures of society and the ceremonies performed to ensure continuity of life and land.[327]

        Health
        See also: Health care in Australia
        Australia's life expectancy of 83 years (81 years for males and 85 years for females)[328] is the fifth-highest in the world. It has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world,[329] while cigarette smoking is the largest preventable cause of death and disease, responsible for 7.8% of the total mortality and disease. Ranked second in preventable causes is hypertension at 7.6%, with obesity third at 7.5%.[330][331] Australia ranked 35th in the world in 2012 for its proportion of obese women[332] and near the top of developed nations for its proportion of obese adults;[333] 63% of its adult population is either overweight or obese.[334]

        Australia spent around 9.91% of its total GDP to health care in 2021.[335] It introduced a national insurance scheme in 1975.[336] Following a period in which access to the scheme was restricted, the scheme became universal once more in 1981 under the name of Medicare.[337] The program is nominally funded by an income tax surcharge known as the Medicare levy, currently at 2%.[338] The states manage hospitals and attached outpatient services, while the Commonwealth funds the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (subsidising the costs of medicines) and general practice.[336]

        Education
        Main article: Education in Australia

        Australia has the highest ratio of international students per capita in the world, with Melbourne ranking fifth among the 2023 QS Best Student Cities (University of Melbourne pictured).
        School attendance, or registration for home schooling,[339] is compulsory throughout Australia. Education is primarily the responsibility of the individual states and territories; however, the Commonwealth has significant influence through funding agreements.[340] Since 2014, a national curriculum developed by the Commonwealth has been implemented by the states and territories.[341] Attendance rules vary between states, but in general children are required to attend school from the age of about 5 until about 16.[342][343] In some states (Western Australia, Northern Territory and New South Wales), children aged 16–17 are required to either attend school or participate in vocational training, such as an apprenticeship.[344][345][346][347] According to the 2022 PISA evaluations, Australian 15-year-olds ranked ninth in the OECD for reading and science and tenth for maths. However, less than 60% of Australian students achieved the National Proficiency Standard – 51% in maths, 58% in science and 57% in reading.[348][349]

        Australia has an adult literacy rate that was estimated to be 99% in 2003.[350] However, a 2011–2012 report for the Australian Bureau of Statistics found that 44% of the population does not have high literary and numeracy competence levels, interpreted by others as suggesting that they do not have the "skills needed for everyday life".[351][352][353]

        Australia has 37 government-funded universities and three private universities, as well as a number of other specialist institutions that provide approved courses at the higher education level.[354] The OECD places Australia among the most expensive nations to attend university.[355] There is a state-based system of vocational training, known as TAFE, and many trades conduct apprenticeships for training new tradespeople.[356] About 58% of Australians aged from 25 to 64 have vocational or tertiary qualifications[357] and the tertiary graduation rate of 49% is the highest among OECD countries. 30.9% of Australia's population has attained a higher education qualification, which is among the highest percentages in the world.[358][359][360]

        Australia has the highest ratio of international students per head of population in the world by a large margin, with 812,000 international students enrolled in the nation's universities and vocational institutions in 2019.[361][362] Accordingly, in 2019, international students represented on average 26.7% of the student bodies of Australian universities. International education therefore represents one of the country's largest exports and has a pronounced influence on the country's demographics, with a significant proportion of international students remaining in Australia after graduation on various skill and employment visas.[363] Education is Australia's third-largest export, after iron ore and coal, and contributed more than $28 billion to the economy in the 2016–17 financial year.[N 12][288]

        Culture
        Main article: Culture of Australia

        The Sydney Opera House was completed in 1973 and declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007, making it the youngest building to have received the designation.[364]
        Contemporary Australian culture is diverse[365] and reflects the country's Indigenous traditions, British and Irish heritage, and post-1945 history of multicultural immigration.[366][367] The culture of the United States has also been influential.[368] The evolution of Australian culture since British colonisation has given rise to distinctive cultural traits.[369][370]

        Many Australians identify egalitarianism, mateship, irreverence and a lack of formality as part of their national identity.[371][372][373] These find expression in Australian slang, as well as Australian humour, which is often characterised as dry, irreverent and ironic.[374][375] New citizens and visa holders are required to commit to "Australian values", which are identified by the Department of Home Affairs as including: a respect for the freedom of the individual; recognition of the rule of law; opposition to racial, gender and religious discrimination; and an understanding of the "fair go", which is said to encompass the equality of opportunity for all and compassion for those in need.[376] What these values mean, and whether Australians uphold them, has been debated since before Federation.[377][378][379][380]

        Arts
        Main articles: Australian art, Australian literature, Theatre of Australia, Dance in Australia, and Music of Australia

        Held at the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, Tasmania, Sidney Nolan's Snake mural (1970) is inspired by the Aboriginal creation myth of the Rainbow Serpent, as well as desert flowers in bloom after a drought.[381]
        Australia has more than 100,000 Aboriginal rock art sites,[382] and traditional designs, patterns and stories infuse contemporary Indigenous Australian art, "the last great art movement of the 20th century" according to critic Robert Hughes;[383] its exponents include Emily Kame Kngwarreye.[384] Early colonial artists showed a fascination with the unfamiliar land.[385] The impressionistic works of Arthur Streeton, Tom Roberts and other members of the 19th-century Heidelberg School—the first "distinctively Australian" movement in Western art—gave expression to nationalist sentiments in the lead-up to Federation.[385] While the school remained influential into the 1900s, modernists such as Margaret Preston and Clarice Beckett, and, later, Sidney Nolan, explored new artistic trends.[385] The landscape remained central to the work of Aboriginal watercolourist Albert Namatjira,[386] as well as Fred Williams, Brett Whiteley and other post-war artists whose works, eclectic in style yet uniquely Australian, moved between the figurative and the abstract.[385][387]

        Australian literature grew slowly in the decades following European settlement though Indigenous oral traditions, many of which have since been recorded in writing, are much older.[388] In the 19th century, Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson captured the experience of the bush using a distinctive Australian vocabulary.[389] Their works are still popular; Paterson's bush poem "Waltzing Matilda" (1895) is regarded as Australia's unofficial national anthem.[390] Miles Franklin is the namesake of Australia's most prestigious literary prize, awarded annually to the best novel about Australian life.[391] Its first recipient, Patrick White, went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1973.[392] Australian Booker Prize winners include Peter Carey, Thomas Keneally and Richard Flanagan.[393] Australian public intellectuals have also written seminal works in their respective fields, including feminist Germaine Greer and philosopher Peter Singer.[394]


        Arising from the Australian pub rock scene, AC/DC ranks among the world's best-selling music acts.
        In the performing arts, Aboriginal peoples have traditions of religious and secular song, dance and rhythmic music often performed in corroborees.[49] At the beginning of the 20th century, Nellie Melba was one of the world's leading opera singers,[395] and later popular music acts such as the Bee Gees, AC/DC, INXS and Kylie Minogue achieved international recognition.[396] Many of Australia's performing arts companies receive funding through the Australian government's Australia Council.[397] There is a symphony orchestra in each state,[398] and a national opera company, Opera Australia,[399] well known for its famous soprano Joan Sutherland.[400] Ballet and dance are represented by The Australian Ballet and various state companies. Each state has a publicly funded theatre company.[401]

        Actor playing the bushranger and outlaw Ned Kelly in The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906), the world's first feature-length narrative film
        The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906), the world's first feature-length narrative film, spurred a boom in Australian cinema during the silent film era.[402] After World War I, Hollywood monopolised the industry,[403] and by the 1960s, Australian film production had effectively ceased.[404] With the benefit of government support, the Australian New Wave of the 1970s brought provocative and successful films, many exploring themes of national identity, such as Picnic at Hanging Rock, Wake in Fright and Gallipoli,[405] while Crocodile Dundee and the Ozploitation movement's Mad Max series became international blockbusters.[406] In a film market flooded with foreign content, Australian films delivered a 7.7% share of the local box office in 2015.[407] The AACTAs are Australia's premier film and television awards, and notable Academy Award winners from Australia include Geoffrey Rush, Nicole Kidman, Cate Blanchett and Heath Ledger.[408]

        Australia has two public broadcasters (the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the multicultural Special Broadcasting Service), three commercial television networks, several pay-TV services,[409] and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has at least one daily newspaper,[409] and there are two national daily newspapers, The Australian and The Australian Financial Review.[409] In 2024, Reporters Without Borders placed Australia 39th on a list of 180 countries ranked by press freedom, behind New Zealand (19th) and the United Kingdom (23rd), but ahead of the United States (55th).[410] This relatively low ranking is primarily because of the limited diversity of commercial media ownership in Australia;[411] most print media are under the control of News Corp Australia (59%) and Nine Entertainment (23%).[412]

        Cuisine
        Main article: Australian cuisine

        South Australian wines
        Most Indigenous Australian groups subsisted on a diet of native fauna and flora, otherwise called bush tucker.[413] It has increased in popularity among non-Indigenous Australians since the 1970s, with examples such as lemon myrtle, the macadamia nut and kangaroo meat now widely available.[414][415]

        The first colonists introduced British and Irish cuisine to the continent.[416][417] This influence is seen in dishes such as fish and chips, and in the Australian meat pie, which is related to the British steak pie. Also during the colonial period, Chinese migrants paved the way for a distinctive Australian Chinese cuisine.[418]

        Post-war migrants transformed Australian cuisine, bringing with them their culinary traditions and contributing to new fusion dishes.[419] Italians introduced espresso coffee and, along with Greeks, helped develop Australia's café culture, of which the flat white and avocado toast are now considered Australian staples.[420][421] Pavlovas, lamingtons, Vegemite and Anzac biscuits are also often called iconic Australian foods.[422]

        Australia is a leading exporter and consumer of wine.[423] Australian wine is produced mainly in the southern, cooler parts of the country.[424] The nation also ranks highly in beer consumption,[425] with each state and territory hosting numerous breweries.

        Sport and recreation
        Main article: Sport in Australia

        The Melbourne Cricket Ground is strongly associated with the history and development of cricket and Australian rules football, Australia's two most popular spectator sports.[426]
        The most popular sports in Australia by adult participation are: swimming, athletics, cycling, soccer, golf, tennis, basketball, surfing, netball and cricket.[427]

        Australia is one of five nations to have participated in every Summer Olympics of the modern era,[428] and has hosted the Games twice: 1956 in Melbourne and 2000 in Sydney.[429] It is also set to host the 2032 Games in Brisbane.[430] Australia has also participated in every Commonwealth Games,[431] hosting the event in 1938, 1962, 1982, 2006 and 2018.[432]

        The Australian national cricket team competed against England in the first Test match (1877) and the first One Day International (1971), and against New Zealand in the first Twenty20 International (2004), winning all three games.[433] It has also won the men's Cricket World Cup a record six times.[434]

        Australia has professional leagues for four football codes, whose relative popularity is divided geographically.[435] Originating in Melbourne in the 1850s, Australian rules football attracts the most television viewers in all states except New South Wales and Queensland, where rugby league holds sway, followed by rugby union.[436] Soccer, while ranked fourth in television viewers and resources, has the highest overall participation rates.[437]

        The surf lifesaving movement originated in Australia in the early 20th century, following the relaxation of laws prohibiting daylight bathing on Australian beaches. The volunteer lifesaver is one of the country's icons.[438][439]

        Notes
        Australia also has a royal anthem, "God Save the King", which may be played in place of or alongside the national anthem when members of the royal family are present. If not played alongside the royal anthem, the national anthem is instead played at the end of an official event.[1]
        Sydney is the largest city based on Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSAs). These represent labour markets and the functional area of Australian capital cities.[2] Melbourne is larger based on ABS Significant Urban Areas (SUAs). These represent Urban Centres, or groups of contiguous Urban Centres, that contain a population of 10,000 people or more.[3]
        The religion question is optional in the Australian census.

        There are minor variations from three basic time zones; see Time in Australia.
        42% of the Antarctic continent is also claimed by the country; however this is only recognised by the UK, France, New Zealand and Norway.[16]
        Includes those who nominate "Australian" as their ancestry.[4] The Australian Bureau of Statistics has stated that most who nominate "Australian" as their ancestry have at least partial Anglo-Celtic European ancestry.[311]
        Each person may nominate more than one ancestry, so the total may exceed 100%.[308]
        The Australian Bureau of Statistics has stated that most who nominate "Australian" as their ancestry have at least partial Anglo-Celtic European ancestry.[311]
        Those who nominated their ancestry as "Australian Aboriginal". Does not include Torres Strait Islanders. This relates to nomination of ancestry and is distinct from persons who identify as Indigenous (Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander), which is a separate question.
        Indigenous identification is separate to the ancestry question on the Australian Census and persons identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander may identify any ancestry.
        That is, 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017.

        <p>Argentina,[C] officially the Argentine Republic,[A][D] is a country in the southern half of South America. It covers an area of 2,780,085 km2 (1,073,397 sq mi),[B] making it the second-largest country in South America after Brazil, the fourth-largest country in the Americas, and the eighth-largest country in the world. Argentina shares the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west, and is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. Argentina is a federal state subdivided into twenty-three provinces, and one autonomous city, which is the federal capital and largest city of the nation, Buenos Aires. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. Argentina claims sovereignty over the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, and a part of Antarctica.

        The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period.[14] The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in pre-Columbian times. The modern country has its roots in Spanish colonisation of the region during the 16th century.[15] Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata,[16] a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776. The Argentine Declaration of Independence on July 9 of 1816 and the Argentine War of Independence (1810–1825) were followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1880, culminating in the country's reorganisation as a federation. The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability, with several subsequent waves of European immigration, mainly of Italians and Spaniards, influencing its culture and demography.[17][18][19][20]

        The National Autonomist Party dominated national politics in the period called the Conservative Republic, from 1880 until the 1916 elections. The Great Depression led to the first coup d'état in 1930 led by José Félix Uriburu, beginning the so-called "Infamous Decade" (1930–1943). After that coup, four more followed in 1943, 1955, 1962, and 1966. Following the death of President Juan Perón in 1974, his widow and vice president, Isabel Perón, ascended to the presidency, before being overthrown in the final coup in 1976. The following military junta persecuted and murdered thousands of political critics, activists, and leftists in the Dirty War, a period of state terrorism and civil unrest that lasted until the election of Raúl Alfonsín as president in 1983.

        Argentina is a regional power, and retains its historic status as a middle power in international affairs.[21][22][23] A major non-NATO ally of the United States,[24] Argentina is a developing country with the second-highest HDI (human development index) in Latin America after Chile.[25] It maintains the second-largest economy in South America, and is a member of G-15 and G20. Argentina is also a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, World Trade Organization, Mercosur, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Organization of Ibero-American States.

        Etymology
        Main article: Etymology of Argentina
        The description of the region by the word Argentina has been found on a Venetian map in 1536.[26]

        In English, the name Argentina comes from the Spanish language; however, the naming itself is not Spanish, but Italian. Argentina (masculine argentino) means in Italian '(made) of silver, silver coloured', derived from the Latin argentum for silver. In Italian, the adjective or the proper noun is often used in an autonomous way as a substantive and replaces it and it is said l'Argentina.

        The name Argentina was probably first given by the Venetian and Genoese navigators, such as Giovanni Caboto. In Spanish and Portuguese, the words for 'silver' are respectively plata and prata and '(made) of silver' is plateado and prateado, although argento for 'silver' and argentado for 'covered in silver' exist in Spanish. Argentina was first associated with the silver mountains legend, widespread among the first European explorers of the La Plata Basin.[27]

        The first written use of the name in Spanish can be traced to La Argentina,[E] a 1602 poem by Martín del Barco Centenera describing the region.[28] Although "Argentina" was already in common usage by the 18th century, the country was formally named "Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata" by the Spanish Empire, and "United Provinces of the Río de la Plata" after independence.

        The 1826 constitution included the first use of the name "Argentine Republic" in legal documents.[29] The name "Argentine Confederation" was also commonly used and was formalised in the Argentine Constitution of 1853.[30] In 1860 a presidential decree settled the country's name as "Argentine Republic",[31] and that year's constitutional amendment ruled all the names since 1810 as legally valid.[32][F]

        In English, the country was traditionally called "the Argentine", mimicking the typical Spanish usage la Argentina[33] and perhaps resulting from a mistaken shortening of the fuller name 'Argentine Republic'. 'The Argentine' fell out of fashion during the mid-to-late 20th century, and now the country is referred to as "Argentina".

        The Cave of the Hands in Santa Cruz province
        Evidence suggests that humans inhabited what is now Argentina as early as 21,000 years ago. In 2015, fossilised bones of a large, extinct armored mammal called Neosclerocalyptus were unearthed near Buenos Aires. These bones bore cut marks indicative of butchering with stone tools, implying human activity during the Last Glacial Maximum.[34][14] Further south, the Piedra Museo site in Santa Cruz Province has yielded human remains and artifacts dating back approximately 11,000 years. Discoveries at this site include spearheads associated with extinct megafauna such as Mylodon and Hippidion, highlighting the advanced hunting practices of early inhabitants.[35][36] Another significant site is the Cueva de las Manos (Cave of the Hands), also located in Santa Cruz. This cave features stenciled handprints and hunting scenes created between 7,300 BC and 700 AD, offering insights into the lives of early hunter-gatherer communities.[37][36]

        Until the period of European colonisation, Argentina was relatively sparsely populated by a wide number of diverse cultures with different social organisations,[38] which can be divided into three main groups.[39] The first group are basic hunters and food gatherers without the development of pottery, such as the Selkʼnam and Yaghan in the extreme south. The second group are advanced hunters and food gatherers which include the Puelche, Querandí and Serranos in the centre-east; and the Tehuelche in the south—all of them conquered by the Mapuche spreading from Chile[40]—and the Kom and Wichi in the north. The last group are farmers with pottery, such as the Charrúa, Minuane and Guaraní in the northeast, with slash and burn semisedentary existence;[38] the advanced Diaguita sedentary trading culture in the northwest, which was conquered by the Inca Empire around 1480; the Tonocoté and Hênîa and Kâmîare in the country's centre, and the Huarpe in the centre-west, a culture that raised llama cattle and was strongly influenced by the Incas.[38]

        Colonial era

        Europeans first arrived in the region with the 1502 voyage of Amerigo Vespucci. The Spanish navigators Juan Díaz de Solís and Sebastian Cabot visited the territory that is now Argentina in 1516 and 1526, respectively.[15] In 1536 Pedro de Mendoza founded the small settlement of Buenos Aires, which was abandoned in 1541.[41]

        Further colonisation efforts came from Paraguay—establishing the Governorate of the Río de la Plata—Peru and Chile.[42] Francisco de Aguirre founded Santiago del Estero in 1553. Londres was founded in 1558; Mendoza, in 1561; San Juan, in 1562; San Miguel de Tucumán, in 1565.[43] Juan de Garay founded Santa Fe in 1573 and the same year Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera set up Córdoba.[44] Garay went further south to re-found Buenos Aires in 1580.[45] San Luis was established in 1596.[43]

        The Spanish Empire subordinated the economic potential of the Argentine territory to the immediate wealth of the silver and gold mines in Bolivia and Peru, and as such it became part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until the creation of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata in 1776 with Buenos Aires as its capital.[46]

        Buenos Aires repelled two ill-fated British invasions in 1806 and 1807.[47] The ideas of the Age of Enlightenment and the example of the first Atlantic Revolutions generated criticism of the absolutist monarchy that ruled the country. As in the rest of Spanish America, the overthrow of Ferdinand VII during the Peninsular War created great concern.[48]

        Independence and civil wars

        Beginning a process from which Argentina was to emerge as successor state to the Viceroyalty,[16] the 1810 May Revolution replaced the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros with the First Junta, a new government in Buenos Aires made up from locals.[48] In the first clashes of the Independence War the Junta crushed a royalist counter-revolution in Córdoba,[50] but failed to overcome those of the Banda Oriental, Upper Peru and Paraguay, which later became independent states.[51] The French-Argentine Hippolyte Bouchard then brought his fleet to wage war against Spain overseas and attacked Spanish California, Spanish Peru and Spanish Philippines. He secured the allegiance of escaped Filipinos in San Blas who defected from the Spanish to join the Argentine navy, due to common Argentine and Philippine grievances against Spanish colonisation.[52][53] Jose de San Martin's brother, Juan Fermín de San Martín, was already in the Philippines and drumming up revolutionary fervor prior to this.[54] At a later date, the Argentine sign of Inca origin, the Sun of May was adopted as a symbol by the Filipinos in the Philippine Revolution against Spain. He also secured the diplomatic recognition of Argentina from King Kamehameha I of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Historian Pacho O'Donnell affirms that Hawaii was the first state that recognised Argentina's independence.[55] He was finally arrested in 1819 by Chilean patriots.

        Revolutionaries split into two antagonist groups: the Centralists and the Federalists—a move that would define Argentina's first decades of independence.[56] The Assembly of the Year XIII appointed Gervasio Antonio de Posadas as Argentina's first Supreme Director.[56]

        On 9 July 1816, the Congress of Tucumán formalised the Declaration of Independence,[57] which is now celebrated as Independence Day, a national holiday.[58] One year later General Martín Miguel de Güemes stopped royalists on the north. General José de San Martín joined Bernardo O'Higgins, and they led a combined army across the Andes and secured the independence of Chile; then it was sent by O'Higgins orders to the Spanish stronghold of Lima and proclaimed the independence of Peru.[59][G] In 1819 Buenos Aires enacted a centralist constitution that was soon abrogated by federalists.[61]

        Some of the most important figures of Argentine independence made a proposal known as the Inca plan of 1816, which proposed that the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (Present Argentina) should be a monarchy, led by a descendant of the Inca. Juan Bautista Túpac Amaru (half-brother of Túpac Amaru II) was proposed as monarch.[62] Some examples of those who supported this proposal were Manuel Belgrano, José de San Martín and Martín Miguel de Güemes. The Congress of Tucumán finally decided to reject the Inca plan, creating instead a republican, centralist state.[63][64]

        The 1820 Battle of Cepeda, fought between the Centralists and the Federalists, resulted in the end of the Supreme Director rule. In 1826 Buenos Aires enacted another centralist constitution, with Bernardino Rivadavia being appointed as the first president of the country. However, the interior provinces soon rose against him, forced his resignation and discarded the constitution.[65] Centralists and Federalists resumed the civil war; the latter prevailed and formed the Argentine Confederation in 1831, led by Juan Manuel de Rosas.[66] During his regime he faced a French blockade (1838–1840), the War of the Confederation (1836–1839), and an Anglo-French blockade (1845–1850), but remained undefeated and prevented further loss of national territory.[67] His trade restriction policies, however, angered the interior provinces and in 1852 Justo José de Urquiza, another powerful caudillo, beat him out of power. As the new president of the Confederation, Urquiza enacted the liberal and federal 1853 Constitution. Buenos Aires seceded but was forced back into the Confederation after being defeated in the 1859 Battle of Cepeda.[68]

        Immigrants from Italy arriving in Buenos Aires, during the great European immigration wave to Argentina
        Overpowering Urquiza in the 1861 Battle of Pavón, Bartolomé Mitre secured Buenos Aires' predominance and was elected as the first president of the reunified country. He was followed by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and Nicolás Avellaneda; these three presidencies set up the basis of the modern Argentine State.[69]

        Starting with Julio Argentino Roca in 1880, ten consecutive federal governments emphasised liberal economic policies. The massive wave of European immigration they promoted—second only to the United States'—led to a near-reinvention of Argentine society and economy that by 1908 had placed the country as the seventh wealthiest[70] developed nation[71] in the world. Driven by this immigration wave and decreasing mortality, the Argentine population grew fivefold and the economy 15-fold:[72] from 1870 to 1910, Argentina's wheat exports went from 100,000 to 2,500,000 t (110,000 to 2,760,000 short tons) per year, while frozen beef exports increased from 25,000 to 365,000 t (28,000 to 402,000 short tons) per year,[73] placing Argentina as one of the world's top five exporters.[74] Its railway mileage rose from 503 to 31,104 km (313 to 19,327 mi).[75] Fostered by a new public, compulsory, free and secular education system, literacy quickly increased from 22% to 65%, a level higher than most Latin American nations would reach even fifty years later.[74] Furthermore, real GDP grew so fast that despite the huge immigration influx, per capita income between 1862 and 1920 went from 67% of developed country levels to 100%:[75] In 1865, Argentina was already one of the top 25 nations by per capita income. By 1908, it had surpassed Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands to reach 7th place—behind Switzerland, New Zealand, Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Belgium. Argentina's per capita income was 70% higher than Italy's, 90% higher than Spain's, 180% higher than Japan's and 400% higher than Brazil's.[70] Despite these unique achievements, the country was slow to meet its original goals of industrialisation:[76] after the steep development of capital-intensive local industries in the 1920s, a significant part of the manufacturing sector remained labour-intensive in the 1930s.[77]


        Conquest of the Desert, by Juan Manuel Blanes (fragment showing Julio Argentino Roca, at the front, a major figure of the Generation of '80)[78]
        Between 1878 and 1884, the so-called Conquest of the Desert occurred, with the purpose of tripling the Argentine territory by means of the constant confrontations between natives and Criollos in the border,[79] and the appropriation of the indigenous territories. The first conquest consisted of a series of military incursions into the Pampa and Patagonian territories dominated by the indigenous peoples,[80] distributing them among the members of the Sociedad Rural Argentina, financiers of the expeditions.[81] The conquest of Chaco lasted up to the end of the century,[82] since its full ownership of the national economic system only took place when the mere extraction of wood and tannin was replaced by the production of cotton.[83] The Argentine government considered indigenous people as inferior beings, without the same rights as Criollos and Europeans.[84]

        In 1912, President Roque Sáenz Peña enacted universal and secret male suffrage, which allowed Hipólito Yrigoyen, leader of the Radical Civic Union (or UCR), to win the 1916 election. He enacted social and economic reforms and extended assistance to small farms and businesses. Argentina stayed neutral during World War I. The second administration of Yrigoyen faced an economic crisis, precipitated by the Great Depression.[85]


        Crowds outside the Argentine National Congress during the 1930 Argentine coup d'état which marked the start of the Infamous Decade
        In 1930, Yrigoyen was ousted from power by the military led by José Félix Uriburu. Although Argentina remained among the fifteen richest countries until mid-century,[70] this coup d'état marks the start of the steady economic and social decline that pushed the country back into underdevelopment.[86]

        Uriburu ruled for two years; then Agustín Pedro Justo was elected in a fraudulent election, and signed a controversial treaty with the United Kingdom. Argentina stayed neutral during World War II, a decision that had full British support but was rejected by the United States after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1943 a military coup d'état led by General Arturo Rawson toppled the constitutional government of Ramón Castillo. Under pressure from the United States, later Argentina declared war on the Axis Powers (on 27 March 1945, roughly a month before the end of World War II in Europe).

        During the Rawson dictatorship a relatively unknown military colonel named Juan Perón was named head of the Labour Department. Perón quickly managed to climb the political ladder, being named defence minister in 1944. Being perceived as a political threat by rivals in the military and the conservative camp, he was forced to resign in 1945, and was arrested days later. He was finally released under mounting pressure from both his base and several allied unions.[87] He later became president after a landslide victory over the UCR in the 1946 general election as the Labour candidate.[88]

        Peronist years

        The Labour Party (later renamed Justicialist Party), the most powerful and influential party in Argentine history, came into power with the rise of Juan Perón to the presidency in 1946. He nationalised strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full external debt and claimed he achieved nearly full employment. He pushed Congress to enact women's suffrage in 1947,[89] and developed a system of social assistance for the most vulnerable sectors of society.[90] The economy began to decline in 1950 due in part to government expenditures and the protectionist economic policies.[91]

        He also engaged in a campaign of political suppression. Anyone who was perceived to be a political dissident or potential rival was subject to threats, physical violence and harassment. The Argentine intelligentsia, the middle-class, university students, and professors were seen as particularly troublesome. Perón fired over 2,000 university professors and faculty members from all major public education institutions.[92]

        Perón tried to bring most trade and labour unions under his thumb, regularly resorting to violence when needed. For instance, the meat-packers union leader, Cipriano Reyes, organised strikes in protest against the government after elected labour movement officials were forcefully replaced by Peronist puppets from the Peronist Party. Reyes was soon arrested on charges of terrorism, though the allegations were never substantiated. Reyes, who was never formally charged, was tortured in prison for five years and only released after the regime's downfall in 1955.[93]

        Perón managed to get reelected in 1951. His wife Eva Perón, who played a critical role in the party, died of cancer in 1952. As the economy continued to tank, Perón started losing popular support, and came to be seen as a threat to the national process. The Navy took advantage of Perón's withering political power, and bombed the Plaza de Mayo in 1955. Perón survived the attack, but a few months later, during the Liberating Revolution coup, he was deposed and went into exile in Spain.[94]

        The new head of State, Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, proscribed Peronism and banned the party from any future elections. Arturo Frondizi from the UCR won the 1958 general election.[95] He encouraged investment to achieve energetic and industrial self-sufficiency, reversed a chronic trade deficit and lifted the ban on Peronism; yet his efforts to stay on good terms with both the Peronists and the military earned him the rejection of both and a new coup forced him out.[96] Amidst the political turmoil, Senate leader José María Guido reacted swiftly and applied anti-power vacuum legislation, ascending to the presidency himself; elections were repealed and Peronism was prohibited once again. Arturo Illia was elected in 1963 and led an increase in prosperity across the board; however he was overthrown in 1966 by another military coup d'état led by General Juan Carlos Onganía in the self-proclaimed Argentine Revolution, creating a new military government that sought to rule indefinitely.[97]

        Perón's return and death
        Following several years of military rule, Alejandro Agustín Lanusse was appointed president by the military junta in 1971. Under increasing political pressure for the return of democracy, Lanusse called for elections in 1973. Perón was banned from running but the Peronist party was allowed to participate.[98] The presidential elections were won by Perón's surrogate candidate, Hector Cámpora, a left-wing Peronist, who took office on 25 May 1973. A month later, in June, Perón returned from Spain. One of Cámpora's first presidential actions was to grant amnesty to members of organisations that had carried out political assassinations and terrorist attacks, and to those who had been tried and sentenced to prison by judges. Cámpora's months-long tenure in government was beset by political and social unrest. Over 600 social conflicts, strikes, and factory occupations took place within a single month.[99] Even though far-left terrorist organisations had suspended their armed struggle, their joining with the participatory democracy process was interpreted as a direct threat by the Peronist right-wing faction.[100]

        Amid a state of political, social, and economic upheaval, Cámpora and Vice President Vicente Solano Lima resigned in July 1973, calling for new elections, but this time with Perón as the Justicialist Party nominee. Perón won the election with his wife Isabel Perón as vice president. Perón's third term was marked by escalating conflict between left and right-wing factions within the Peronist party, as well as the return of armed terror guerrilla groups such as the Guevarist ERP, leftist Peronist Montoneros, and the state-backed far-right Triple A. After a series of heart attacks and signs of pneumonia in 1974, Perón's health deteriorated quickly. He suffered a final heart attack on Monday, 1 July 1974, and died at 13:15. He was 78 years old. After his death, Isabel Perón, his wife and vice president, succeeded him in office. During her presidency, a military junta, along with the Peronists' far-right fascist faction, once again became the de facto head of state. Isabel Perón served as President of Argentina from 1974 until 1976, when she was ousted by the military. Her short presidency was marked by the collapse of Argentine political and social systems, leading to a constitutional crisis that paved the way for a decade of instability, left-wing terrorist guerrilla attacks, and state-sponsored terrorism.[91][101][102][103][104]

        National Reorganization Process

        The "first military junta" – Admiral Emilio Massera, Lieutenant General Jorge Videla and Brigadier General Orlando Agosti (from left to right) – observing the Independence Day military parade on Avenida del Libertador, 9 July 1978
        The "Dirty War" (Spanish: Guerra Sucia) was part of Operation Condor, which included the participation of other right-wing dictatorships in the Southern Cone. The Dirty War involved state terrorism in Argentina and elsewhere in the Southern Cone against political dissidents, with military and security forces employing urban and rural violence against left-wing guerrillas, political dissidents, and anyone believed to be associated with socialism or somehow contrary to the neoliberal economic policies of the regime.[105][106][107] Victims of the violence in Argentina alone included an estimated 15,000 to 30,000 left-wing activists and militants, including trade unionists, students, journalists, Marxists, Peronist guerrillas,[108] and alleged sympathisers. Most of the victims were casualties of state terrorism. The opposing guerrillas' victims numbered nearly 500–540 military and police officials[109] and up to 230 civilians.[110] Argentina received technical support and military aid from the United States government during the Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan administrations.

        The exact chronology of the repression is still debated, yet the roots of the long political war may have started in 1969 when trade unionists were targeted for assassination by Peronist and Marxist paramilitaries. Individual cases of state-sponsored terrorism against Peronism and the left can be traced back even further to the Bombing of Plaza de Mayo in 1955. The Trelew massacre of 1972, the actions of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance commencing in 1973, and Isabel Perón's "annihilation decrees" against left-wing guerrillas during Operativo Independencia (Operation Independence) in 1975, are also possible events signaling the beginning of the Dirty War.[H]

        Onganía shut down Congress, banned all political parties, and dismantled student and worker unions. In 1969, popular discontent led to two massive protests: the Cordobazo and the Rosariazo. The terrorist guerrilla organisation Montoneros kidnapped and executed Aramburu.[114] The newly chosen head of government, Alejandro Agustín Lanusse, seeking to ease the growing political pressure, allowed Héctor José Cámpora to become the Peronist candidate instead of Perón. Cámpora won the March 1973 election, issued pardons for condemned guerrilla members, and then secured Perón's return from his exile in Spain.[115]

        On the day Perón returned to Argentina, the clash between Peronist internal factions—right-wing union leaders and left-wing youth from the Montoneros—resulted in the Ezeiza Massacre. Overwhelmed by political violence, Cámpora resigned and Perón won the following September 1973 election with his third wife Isabel as vice-president. He expelled Montoneros from the party[116] and they became once again a clandestine organisation. José López Rega organised the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (AAA) to fight against them and the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP).[117][118]

        Perón died in July 1974 and was succeeded by his wife, who signed a secret decree empowering the military and the police to "annihilate" the left-wing subversion,[119] stopping ERP's attempt to start a rural insurgence in Tucumán province.[120] Isabel Perón was ousted one year later by a junta of the combined armed forces, led by army general Jorge Rafael Videla. They initiated the National Reorganization Process, often shortened to Proceso.[121]

        The Proceso shut down Congress, removed the judges on the Supreme Court, banned political parties and unions, and resorted to employing the forced disappearance of suspected guerrilla members including individuals suspected of being associated with the left-wing. By the end of 1976, the Montoneros had lost nearly 2,000 members and by 1977, the ERP was completely subdued. Nevertheless, the severely weakened Montoneros launched a counterattack in 1979, which was quickly put down, effectively ending the guerrilla threat and securing the junta's position in power.[citation needed]

        In March 1982, an Argentine force took control of the British territory of South Georgia and, on 2 April, Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. The United Kingdom dispatched a task force to regain possession. Argentina surrendered on 14 June and its forces were taken home. Street riots in Buenos Aires followed the humiliating defeat and the military leadership stood down.[122][123] Reynaldo Bignone replaced Galtieri and began to organise the transition to democratic governance.[124]

        Menem (left) with Fernando de la Rúa on 10 December 1999 just after the latter became president
        Raúl Alfonsín won the 1983 elections campaigning for the prosecution of those responsible for human rights violations during the Proceso: the Trial of the Juntas and other martial courts sentenced all the coup's leaders but, under military pressure, he also enacted the Full Stop and Due Obedience laws,[125][126] which halted prosecutions further down the chain of command. The worsening economic crisis and hyperinflation reduced his popular support and the Peronist Carlos Menem won the 1989 election. Soon after, riots forced Alfonsín to an early resignation.[127]


        Civil unrest on Plaza de Mayo during the Argentinazo riots, which forced De La Rúa to resign on 21 December 2001
        Menem embraced and enacted neoliberal policies:[128] a fixed exchange rate, business deregulation, privatisations, and the dismantling of protectionist barriers normalised the economy in the short term. He pardoned the officers who had been sentenced during Alfonsín's government. The 1994 Constitutional Amendment allowed Menem to be elected for a second term. With the economy beginning to decline in 1995, and with increasing unemployment and recession,[129] the UCR, led by Fernando de la Rúa, returned to the presidency in the 1999 elections.[130]

        De la Rúa left Menem's economic plan in effect despite the worsening crisis, which led to growing social discontent.[129] Massive capital flight from the country was responded to with a freezing of bank accounts, generating further turmoil. The December 2001 riots forced him to resign.[131] Congress appointed Eduardo Duhalde as acting president, who revoked the fixed exchange rate established by Menem,[132] causing many working- and middle-class Argentines to lose a significant portion of their savings. By late 2002, the economic crisis began to recede, but the assassination of two piqueteros by the police caused political unrest, prompting Duhalde to move elections forward.[133] Néstor Kirchner was elected as the new president. On 26 May 2003, he was sworn in.[134][135]


        Kirchner and his wife Cristina Kirchner just after her presidency began, 10 December 2007
        Boosting the neo-Keynesian economic policies[133] laid by Duhalde, Kirchner ended the economic crisis attaining significant fiscal and trade surpluses, and rapid GDP growth.[136] Under his administration, Argentina restructured its defaulted debt with an unprecedented discount of about 70% on most bonds, paid off debts with the International Monetary Fund,[137] purged the military of officers with dubious human rights records,[138] nullified and voided the Full Stop and Due Obedience laws,[139][I] ruled them as unconstitutional, and resumed legal prosecution of the Junta's crimes. He did not run for reelection, promoting instead the candidacy of his wife, senator Cristina Kirchner who won the 2007 and 2011 elections.[141] During Kirchner's presidency she promoted foreign relations with countries such as Venezuela, Iran, and Cuba, whilst US and UK relations were increasingly strained. Despite increased renewable energy production and subsidies during her tenure, the overall economy had been sluggish since 2011.[142]

        On 22 November 2015, after a tie in the first round of presidential elections on 25 October, centre-right coalition candidate Mauricio Macri won the first ballotage in Argentina's history, beating Front for Victory candidate Daniel Scioli and becoming president-elect.[143] Macri was the first democratically elected non-peronist president since 1916 that managed to complete his term in office without being overthrown.[144] He took office on 10 December 2015 and inherited an economy with a high inflation rate and in a poor shape.[145] In April 2016, the Macri government introduced neoliberal austerity measures intended to tackle inflation and overblown public deficits.[146] Under Macri's administration, economic recovery remained elusive with GDP shrinking 3.4%, inflation totalling 240%, billions of US dollars issued in sovereign debt, and mass poverty increasing by the end of his term.[147][148] He ran for reelection in 2019 but lost by nearly eight percentage points to Alberto Fernández, the Justicialist Party candidate.[149]


        Javier Milei receiving the presidency from Fernández on 10 December 2023
        Fernández and vice president Cristina Kirchner took office in December 2019,[150] just months before the COVID-19 pandemic hit Argentina and among accusations of corruption, bribery and misuse of public funds during Néstor and Cristina Kirchner's presidencies.[151][152] In November 2021, the centre-left coalition of Argentina's ruling Peronist party, Frente de Todos (Front for Everyone), lost its majority in Congress, for the first time in almost 40 years, in midterm legislative elections. The election victory of the centre-right coalition, Juntos por el Cambio (Together for Change) limited Fernández' power during his final two years in office. Losing control of the Senate made it difficult for him to make key appointments, including to the judiciary. It also forced him to negotiate with the opposition on every initiative send to the legislature.[153][154]

        In April 2023, Fernández announced that he would not seek reelection in the next presidential election.[155] The November 2023 election run-off ended in a win for libertarian outsider Javier Milei with 55.7% of the vote against 44.4% to ruling coalition candidate Sergio Massa.[156] Milei's presidency began on 10 December 2023.[157]

        Geography
        Main article: Geography of Argentina

        Topographical map of Argentina
        With a mainland surface area of 2,780,400 km2 (1,073,518 sq mi),[B] Argentina is located in southern South America, sharing land borders with Chile across the Andes to the west;[158] Bolivia and Paraguay to the north; Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east;[159] and the Drake Passage to the south;[160] for an overall land border length of 9,376 km (5,826 mi). Its coastal border over the Río de la Plata and South Atlantic Ocean is 5,117 km (3,180 mi) long.[159]

        Argentina's highest point is Aconcagua in the Mendoza province (6,959 m (22,831 ft) above sea level),[161] also the highest point in the Southern and Western Hemispheres.[162] The lowest point is Laguna del Carbón in the San Julián Great Depression Santa Cruz province (−105 m (−344 ft) below sea level,[161] also the lowest point in the Southern and Western Hemispheres, and the seventh lowest point on Earth).[163]

        The northernmost point is at the confluence of the Grande de San Juan and Mojinete rivers in Jujuy province; the southernmost is Cape San Pío in Tierra del Fuego province; the easternmost is northeast of Bernardo de Irigoyen, Misiones and the westernmost is within Los Glaciares National Park in Santa Cruz province.[159] The maximum north–south distance is 3,694 km (2,295 mi), while the maximum east–west one is 1,423 km (884 mi).[159]

        Some of the major rivers are the Paraná, Uruguay—which join to form the Río de la Plata, Paraguay, Salado, Negro, Santa Cruz, Pilcomayo, Bermejo and Colorado.[164] These rivers are discharged into the Argentine Sea, the shallow area of the Atlantic Ocean over the Patagonian Shelf, an unusually wide continental platform.[165] Its waters are influenced by two major ocean currents: the warm Brazil Current and the cold Falklands Current.[166]

        Aconcagua is the highest mountain outside of Asia, at 6,960.8 metres (22,837 ft), and the highest point in the Southern Hemisphere[167]

        Los Cardones National Park
        Argentina is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world[168] hosting one of the greatest ecosystem varieties in the world: 15 continental zones, 2 marine zones, and the Antarctic region are all represented in its territory.[168] This huge ecosystem variety has led to a biological diversity that is among the world's largest:[168][169] 9,372 catalogued vascular plant species (ranked 24th);[J] 1,038 catalogued bird species (ranked 14th);[K] 375 catalogued mammal species (ranked 12th);[L] 338 catalogued reptilian species (ranked 16th); and 162 catalogued amphibian species (ranked 19th).

        In Argentina forest cover is around 10% of the total land area, equivalent to 28,573,000 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 35,204,000 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 27,137,000 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 1,436,000 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 0% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 7% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 0% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership, 4% private ownership and 96% with ownership listed as other or unknown.[170][171]

        The original pampa had virtually no trees; some imported species such as the American sycamore or eucalyptus are present along roads or in towns and country estates (estancias). The only tree-like plant native to the pampa is the evergreen Ombú. The surface soils of the pampa are a deep black colour, primarily mollisols, known commonly as humus. This makes the region one of the most agriculturally productive on Earth; however, this is also responsible for decimating much of the original ecosystem, to make way for commercial agriculture.[citation needed] The western pampas receive less rainfall, this dry pampa is a plain of short grasses or steppe.[172][173]

        The National Parks of Argentina make up a network of 35 national parks in Argentina. The parks cover a very varied set of terrains and biotopes, from Baritú National Park on the northern border with Bolivia to Tierra del Fuego National Park in the far south of the continent. The Administración de Parques Nacionales (National Parks Administration) is the agency that preserves and manages these national parks along with Natural monuments and National Reserves within the country.[174] Argentina had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.21/10, ranking it 47th globally out of 172 countries.[175]

        Climate
        Main articles: Climate of Argentina and Climatic regions of Argentina

        Köppen climate classification in Argentina

        Argentina features geographical locations such as this glacier, known as the Perito Moreno Glacier[176]
        In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm humid subtropical, moderate humid subtropical, arid, and cold, all determined by the expanse across latitude, range in altitude, and relief features.[177][178] Although the most populated areas are generally temperate, Argentina has an exceptional amount of climate diversity,[179] ranging from subtropical in the north to polar in the far south.[180] Consequently, there is a wide variety of biomes in the country, including Subtropical rainforests, semi-arid and arid regions, temperate plains in the Pampas, and cold subantarctic in the south.[181] The average annual precipitation ranges from 150 millimetres (6 in) in the driest parts of Patagonia to over 2,000 millimetres (79 in) in the westernmost parts of Patagonia and the northeastern parts of the country.[179] Mean annual temperatures range from 5 °C (41 °F) in the far south to 25 °C (77 °F) in the north.[179]

        Major wind currents include the cool Pampero Winds blowing on the flat plains of Patagonia and the Pampas; following the cold front, warm currents blow from the north in middle and late winter, creating mild conditions.[182] The Sudestada usually moderates cold temperatures but brings very heavy rains, rough seas and coastal flooding. It is most common in late autumn and winter along the central coast and in the Río de la Plata estuary.[182] The Zonda, a hot dry wind, affects Cuyo and the central Pampas. Squeezed of all moisture during the 6,000 m (19,685 ft) descent from the Andes, Zonda winds can blow for hours with gusts up to 120 km/h (75 mph), fuelling wildfires and causing damage; between June and November, when the Zonda blows, snowstorms and blizzard (viento blanco) conditions usually affect higher elevations.[183]

        Climate change in Argentina is predicted to have significant effects on the living conditions in Argentina.[184]: 30  The climate of Argentina is changing with regards to precipitation patterns and temperatures. The highest increases in precipitation (from the period 1960–2010) have occurred in the eastern parts of the country. The increase in precipitation has led to more variability in precipitation from year to year in the northern parts of the country, with a higher risk of prolonged droughts, disfavouring agriculture in these regions.

        Vice President
        In the 20th century, Argentina experienced significant political turmoil and democratic reversals.[185][186] Between 1930 and 1976, the armed forces overthrew six governments in Argentina;[186] and the country alternated periods of democracy (1912–1930, 1946–1955, and 1973–1976) with periods of restricted democracy and military rule.[185] Following a transition that began in 1983,[187] full-scale democracy in Argentina was reestablished.[185][186] Argentina's democracy endured through the 2001–02 crisis and to the present day; it is regarded as more robust than both its pre-1983 predecessors and other democracies in Latin America.[186] According to International IDEA’s Global State of Democracy (GSoD) Indices and Democracy Tracker, Argentina performs in the mid-range on overall democratic measures, with particular strengths in freedom of religion, inclusive suffrage, and civic engagement.[188][189][190] Moreover, according to the V-Dem Democracy indices, Argentina in 2023 was the second most electoral democratic country in Latin America.[191]

        Government
        Main articles: Government of Argentina and Ministries of the Argentine Republic

        Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires, workplace of the Argentine president

        The National Congress is composed of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.[192]
        Argentina is a federal constitutional republic and representative democracy.[193] The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the Constitution of Argentina, the country's supreme legal document. The seat of government is the city of Buenos Aires, as designated by Congress.[194] Suffrage is universal, equal, secret and mandatory.[195][M]

        The federal government is composed of three branches. The Legislative branch consists of the bicameral Congress, made up of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. The Congress makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties and has the power of the purse and of impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the government.[197] The Chamber of Deputies represents the people and has 257 voting members elected to a four-year term. Seats are apportioned among the provinces by population every tenth year.[198] As of 2014 ten provinces have just five deputies while the Buenos Aires Province, being the most populous one, has 70. The Chamber of Senators represents the provinces, and has 72 members elected at-large to six-year terms, with each province having three seats; one-third of Senate seats are up for election every other year.[199] At least one-third of the candidates presented by the parties must be women.

        In the Executive branch, the President is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law—subject to Congressional override—and appoints the members of the Cabinet and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.[200] The President is elected directly by the vote of the people, serves a four-year term and may be elected to office no more than twice in a row.[201]

        The Judicial branch includes the Supreme Court and lower federal courts interpret laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[202] The Judicial is independent of the Executive and the Legislative. The Supreme Court has seven members appointed by the President—subject to Senate approval—who serve for life. The lower courts' judges are proposed by the Council of Magistracy (a secretariat composed of representatives of judges, lawyers, researchers, the Executive and the Legislative), and appointed by the president on Senate approval.[203]

        Provinces

        Provinces of Argentina. Click to explore.
        Main article: Provinces of Argentina
        Argentina is a federation of twenty-three provinces and one autonomous city, Buenos Aires. Provinces are divided for administration purposes into departments and municipalities, except for Buenos Aires Province, which is divided into partidos. The City of Buenos Aires is divided into communes.

        Provinces hold all the power that they chose not to delegate to the federal government;[204] they must be representative republics and must not contradict the Constitution.[205] Beyond this they are fully autonomous: they enact their own constitutions,[206] freely organise their local governments,[207] and own and manage their natural and financial resources.[208] Some provinces have bicameral legislatures, while others have unicameral ones.[N]

        La Pampa and Chaco became provinces in 1951. Misiones did so in 1953, and Formosa, Neuquén, Río Negro, Chubut and Santa Cruz, in 1955. The last national territory, Tierra del Fuego, became the Tierra del Fuego, Antártida e Islas del Atlántico Sur Province in 1990.[210] It has three components, although two are nominal because they are not under Argentine sovereignty. The first is the Argentine part of Tierra del Fuego; the second is an area of Antarctica claimed by Argentina that overlaps with similar areas claimed by the UK and Chile; the third comprises the two disputed British Overseas Territories of the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.[211]

        Foreign relations
        Main article: Foreign relations of Argentina

        Cristina Kirchner alongside the members of BRICS and Union of South American Nations in 2014
        Foreign policy is handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship, which answers to the President. The country is one of the G-15 and G-20 major economies of the world, and a founding member of the UN, WBG, WTO and OAS. In 2012 Argentina was elected again to a two-year non-permanent position on the United Nations Security Council and is participating in major peacekeeping operations in Haiti, Cyprus, Western Sahara and the Middle East.[212] Argentina is described as a middle power.[21][213]

        A prominent Latin American[22] and Southern Cone[23] regional power, Argentina cofounded OEI and CELAC. It is also a founding member of the Mercosur block, having Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela as partners. Since 2002 the country has emphasised its key role in Latin American integration, and the block—which has some supranational legislative functions—is its first international priority.[214]

        Argentina claims 965,597 km2 (372,819 sq mi) in Antarctica, where it has the world's oldest continuous state presence, since 1904.[215] This overlaps claims by Chile and the United Kingdom, though all such claims fall under the provisions of the 1961 Antarctic Treaty, of which Argentina is a founding signatory and permanent consulting member, with the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat being based in Buenos Aires.[216]

        Argentina disputes sovereignty over the British possessions of the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.[citation needed][217] Argentina is a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.[218] Argentina is a Major non-NATO ally since 1998[24] and an OECD candidate country since January 2022.[219]

        The president holds the title of commander-in-chief of the Argentine Armed Forces, as part of a legal framework that imposes a strict separation between national defence and internal security systems:[220][221] The National Defence System, an exclusive responsibility of the federal government,[222] coordinated by the Ministry of Defence, and comprising the Army, the Navy and the Air Force.[223] Ruled and monitored by Congress[224] through the Houses' Defence Committees,[225] it is organised on the essential principle of legitimate self-defence: the repelling of any external military aggression in order to guarantee freedom of the people, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity.[225] Its secondary missions include committing to multinational operations within the framework of the United Nations, participating in internal support missions, assisting friendly countries, and establishing a sub-regional defence system.[225]

        Military service is voluntary, with enlistment age between 18 and 24 years old and no conscription.[226] Argentina's defence has historically been one of the best equipped in the region, even managing its own weapon research facilities, shipyards, ordnance, tank and plane factories.[227] However, real military expenditures declined steadily after the defeat in the Falklands/Malvinas War and the defence budget in 2011 was only about 0.74% of GDP, a historical minimum,[228] below the Latin American average. Within the defence budget itself, funding for training and even basic maintenance has been significantly cut, a factor contributing to the accidental loss of the Argentine submarine San Juan in 2017. The result has been a steady erosion of Argentine military capabilities, with some arguing that Argentina had, by the end of the 2010s, ceased to be a capable military power.[229]

        The Interior Security System is jointly administered by the federal and subscribing provincial governments.[221] At the federal level it is coordinated by the Interior, Security and Justice ministries, and monitored by Congress.[221] It is enforced by the Federal Police; the Prefecture, which fulfills coast guard duties; the Gendarmerie, which serves border guard tasks; and the Airport Security Police.[230] At the provincial level it is coordinated by the respective internal security ministries and enforced by local police agencies.[221]

        Argentina was the only South American country to send warships and cargo planes in 1991 to the Gulf War under UN mandate and has remained involved in peacekeeping efforts in multiple locations such as UNPROFOR in Croatia/Bosnia, Gulf of Fonseca, UNFICYP in Cyprus (where among Army and Marines troops the Air Force provided the UN Air contingent since 1994) and MINUSTAH in Haiti. Argentina is the only Latin American country to maintain troops in Kosovo during SFOR (and later EUFOR) operations where combat engineers of the Argentine Armed Forces are embedded in an Italian brigade.

        In 2007, an Argentine contingent including helicopters, boats and water purification plants was sent to help Bolivia against their worst floods in decades.[231] In 2010 the Armed Forces were also involved in Haiti and Chile humanitarian responses after their respective earthquakes.[232]

        Benefiting from rich natural resources, a highly literate population, a diversified industrial base, and an export-oriented agricultural sector, Argentina's economy is Latin America's third-largest,[233] and the second-largest in South America.[234] In 1913, Argentina was one of the wealthiest countries in the world by GDP per capita.[235] It has a "very high" rating on the Human Development Index[13] and ranks 66th by nominal GDP per capita,[236] with a considerable internal market size and a growing share of the high-tech sector. As a middle emerging economy and one of the world's top developing nations, it is a member of the G-20 major economies.[237][O]

        Argentina is the largest producer in the world of yerba mate (due to the large domestic consumption of mate), one of the five largest producers in the world of soybeans, maize, sunflower seed, lemon and pear, one of the ten largest producers in the world of barley, grape, artichoke, tobacco and cotton, and one of the 15 largest producers in the world of wheat, sugarcane, sorghum and grapefruit. It is the largest producer in South America of wheat, sunflower seed, barley, lemon and pear.[239][240] In wine, Argentina is usually among the ten largest producers in the world.[241] Argentina is a traditional meat exporter, having been, in 2019, the 4th world producer of beef, with a production of 3 million tons (only behind US, Brazil and China), the 4th world producer of honey, and the 10th world producer of wool, in addition to other relevant productions.[242][243]

        The mining industry of Argentina is less prominent compared to other countries but stands out as the fourth-largest producer of lithium,[244] the 11th-largest of silver[245] and 17th-largest of gold[246] worldwide. Argentina excels in natural gas production, being the largest producer in South America and the 18th-largest globally. Argentina produces an average of 500,000 barrels/day of petroleum, despite the under-utilisation of the Vaca Muerta field due to technical and financial limitations in resource extraction.[247][248]

        In 2012, manufacturing accounted for 20.3% of GDP—the largest sector in Argentina's economy.[249] Well-integrated into Argentine agriculture, half of the industrial exports have rural origin.[249] With a 6.5% production growth rate in 2011,[250] the diversified manufacturing sector rests on a steadily growing network of industrial parks, 314 in 2013.[251][252] In 2012, the leading sectors by volume were: food processing, beverages and tobacco products; motor vehicles and auto parts; textiles and leather; refinery products and biodiesel; chemicals and pharmaceuticals; steel, aluminium and iron; industrial and farm machinery; home appliances and furniture; plastics and tires; glass and cement; and recording and print media.[249] Argentina has since long been one of the top five wine-producing countries in the world.[249]

        High inflation—a weakness of the Argentine economy for decades—has become a trouble once again,[253] recently peaking at 220% in 2024.[254] Approximately 43% of the Argentina's population lived below the poverty line in 2023.[255] To deter it and support the peso, the government imposed foreign currency control.[256] Income distribution, having improved since 2002, is classified as "medium", although it is still considerably unequal.[12] In January 2024, Argentina's poverty rate reached 57.4%, the highest poverty rate in the country since 2004.[257]

        Argentina ranks 85th out of 180 countries in the Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perceptions Index,[258] an improvement of 22 positions over its 2014 rankings.[259] Argentina settled its long-standing debt default crisis in 2016 with the so-called vulture funds after the election of Mauricio Macri, allowing Argentina to enter capital markets for the first time in a decade.[260] The government of Argentina defaulted in May 2020 by failing to pay a $500 million bill by its due date to its creditors. Negotiations for the restructuring of $66 billion of its debt continue.[261]

        Poverty in Argentina was 41.7 percent at the end of the second half of 2023.[262] However, in November 2024, Argentina's monthly inflation rate slowed to 2.4%, the lowest in over four years. Annual inflation was expected to end 2024 closer to 100%.[263] Favourable results and normalisation in Argentina's economy are expected to continue in 2025. The annual inflation rate, which was 211% in 2023, is expected to be below 30% in 2025. Economic activity has also begun to recover after the severe recession at the beginning of 2024. The economy is expected to expand by more than 4% in 2025.[264]

        Tourism
        Main article: Tourism in Argentina
        Argentina had 5.57 million visitors in 2013, the top international tourist destination in South America, and the second in Latin America after Mexico.[265] Revenues from international tourists reached US$4.41 billion in 2013, down from US$4.89 billion in 2012.[265] Argentina's capital city, Buenos Aires, is the most visited city in South America.[266] There are 30 National Parks of Argentina including many World Heritage Sites.

        In 2004, Buenos Aires, all provincial capitals except Ushuaia, and all medium-sized towns were interconnected by 69,412 km (43,131 mi) of paved roads, out of a road network of 231,374 km (143,769 mi).[267] In 2021, Argentina had about 2,800 km (1,740 mi) of dual carriageways, most leaving the capital Buenos Aires, linking it with cities such as Rosario and Córdoba, Santa Fe, Mar del Plata and Paso de los Libres (bordering Brazil). There are also dual carriageways leaving from Mendoza towards the capital, and between Córdoba and Santa Fé, among other locations.[268] Nevertheless, this road infrastructure is still inadequate and cannot handle the sharply growing demand caused by deterioration of the railway system.[269]

        Argentina has the largest railway system in Latin America, with 36,966 km (22,970 mi) of operating lines in 2008, out of a network of almost 48,000 km (29,826 mi).[270] This system links all 23 provinces, plus Buenos Aires City, and connects with all neighbouring countries.[269] There are four incompatible gauges in use; this forces virtually all interregional freight traffic to pass through Buenos Aires.[269] The system has been in decline since the 1940s: regularly running up large budgetary deficits. By 1991, it was transporting 1,400 times less goods than it did in 1973.[269]

        However, in recent years the system has experienced a greater degree of investment from the state, in both commuter rail lines and long-distance lines, renewing rolling stock and infrastructure.[271][272] In April 2015, by overwhelming majority the Argentine Senate passed a law which recreated Ferrocarriles Argentinos, effectively renationalising the country's railways, a move which saw support from all major political parties on both sides of the political spectrum.[273][274][275]

        In 2012, there were about 11,000 km (6,835 mi) of waterways,[276] mostly comprising the La Plata, Paraná, Paraguay and Uruguay rivers, with Buenos Aires, Zárate, Campana, Rosario, San Lorenzo, Santa Fe, Barranqueras and San Nicolas de los Arroyos as the main fluvial ports. Some of the largest sea ports are La Plata–Ensenada, Bahía Blanca, Mar del Plata, Quequén–Necochea, Comodoro Rivadavia, Puerto Deseado, Puerto Madryn, Ushuaia and San Antonio Oeste. Buenos Aires has historically been the most important port. Since the 1990s the Up-River port region has become dominant: stretching along 67 km (42 mi) of the Paraná river shore in Santa Fe province, it includes 17 ports and in 2013 accounted for 50% of all exports.

        In 2013, there were 161 airports with paved runways[277] out of more than a thousand.[269] The Ezeiza International Airport, about 35 km (22 mi) from downtown Buenos Aires,[278] is the largest in Argentina, followed by Cataratas del Iguazú in Misiones, and El Plumerillo in Mendoza.[269] Aeroparque, in the city of Buenos Aires, is the most important domestic airport.[279]

        Energy
        Main article: Electricity sector in Argentina

        Atucha Nuclear Power Plant was the first nuclear power plant in Latin America.[280]
        In 2020, more than 60% of Argentina's electricity came from non-renewable sources such as natural gas, oil and coal. 27% came from hydropower, 7.3% from wind and solar energy and 4.4% from nuclear energy.[281] At the end of 2021 Argentina was the 21st country in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (11.3 GW), the 26th country in the world in terms of installed wind energy (3.2 GW) and the 43rd country in the world in terms of installed solar energy (1.0 GW).[282]

        The wind potential of the Patagonia region is considered gigantic, with estimates that the area could provide enough electricity to sustain the consumption of a country like Brazil alone. However, Argentina has faces infrastructural challenges in transferring electricity from wind-rich rural areas to its population hubs.[283]

        In 1974, Argentina was the first country in Latin America to put a commercial nuclear power plant online, Atucha I. Although the Argentine-built parts for that station amounted to 10% of the total, the nuclear fuel it uses are from Argentina. Later nuclear power stations employed a higher percentage of Argentine-built components. Embalse, finished in 1983, used 30% and the 2011 Atucha II reactor used 40%.[284]

        Science and technology
        Main article: Science and technology in Argentina

        Luis Federico Leloir (left) and his staff toast his 1970 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
        Argentines have received three Nobel Prizes in the Sciences. Bernardo Houssay, the first Latin American recipient, discovered the role of pituitary hormones in regulating glucose in animals, and shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947. Luis Leloir discovered how organisms store energy converting glucose into glycogen and the compounds which are fundamental in metabolising carbohydrates, receiving the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1970. César Milstein did extensive research in antibodies, sharing the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984. Argentine research has led to treatments for heart diseases and several forms of cancer. Domingo Liotta designed and developed the first artificial heart that was successfully implanted in a human being in 1969. René Favaloro developed the techniques and performed the world's first coronary bypass surgery.

        Argentina was the first country in Latin America to design and build a research reactor with homegrown technology, the RA-1 Enrico Fermi. This reliance on the development of its own nuclear-related technologies, instead of buying them abroad, was a constant of Argentina's nuclear programme conducted by the civilian National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA). Nuclear facilities with Argentine technology have been built in Peru, Algeria, Australia and Egypt. In 1983, Argentina admitted having the capability of producing weapon-grade uranium, a major step needed to assemble nuclear weapons. Since then, Argentina has pledged to use nuclear power only for peaceful purposes.[285] As a member of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Argentina supports nuclear non-proliferation efforts[286] and is committed to global nuclear security.[287]


        The SAOCOM 1A inside the facilities of CEATSA
        Despite its modest budget and numerous setbacks, academics and the sciences in Argentina have enjoyed international respect since the 1900s, when Luis Agote devised the first safe and effective means of blood transfusion as well as René Favaloro, who was a pioneer in the improvement of the coronary artery bypass surgery. Argentine scientists are still on the cutting edge in fields such as nanotechnology, physics, computer sciences, molecular biology, oncology, ecology and cardiology. Juan Maldacena, an Argentine-American scientist, is a leading figure in string theory.

        Space research has become increasingly active in Argentina. Argentine-built satellites include LUSAT-1 [es] (1990), Víctor-1 [es] (1996), PEHUENSAT-1 (2007),[288] and those developed by CONAE, the Argentine space agency, of the SAC series.[289] Argentina has its own satellite programme, nuclear power station designs (4th generation) and public nuclear energy company INVAP, which provides several countries with nuclear reactors.[290] Established in 1991, the CONAE has since launched two satellites successfully.[291]

        In June 2009, CONAE secured an agreement with the European Space Agency for the installation of a 35-m diametre antenna and other mission support facilities at the Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's foremost cosmic ray observatory.[292] The facility will contribute to numerous ESA space probes, as well as CONAE's own, domestic research projects. Chosen from 20 potential sites and one of only three such ESA installations in the world, the new antenna will create a triangulation which will allow the ESA to ensure mission coverage around the clock.[293] Argentina was ranked 76th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, [294] and was ranked 77th in 2025.[295]

        Argentine Society for the Study of Mammals
        The Sociedad Argentina para el Estudio de los Mamíferos, SAREM (Argentine Society for the Study of Mammals) in Mendoza, in collaboration with the Center for Science and Technology, Mendoza (CCT), the National Council of Science and Technology (CONICET), and the International Federation of Mammalogists (IFM), hosted the 2009 International Mammalogical Congresses in Mendoza. The Latin American Mammalogy Network (Red Latinoamericana de Mastozoología, or RELAM) was created during the 2009 IMC Congress, cofounded by SAREM and the Asociación Boliviana de Investigadores en Mamíferos (Bolivian Association of Mammal Researchers, ABIMA).[296] The electronic scientific journal Therya, conceived during IMC 10, began publication by the Mexican Association of Mammalogy (AMMAC), in 2010. Doctor William Z. Lidicker Jr., who presided over IMC 10, was the editor.[297]

        Demographics
        Main articles: Demographics of Argentina and Argentines

        A map of Argentina's population density, 2022
        The 2022 census [INDEC] counted 46,044,703 inhabitants, up from 40,117,096 in 2010.[10][298][299] The population in 2024 is estimated to have increased to 47,067,441 inhabitants.[300] Argentina ranks third in South America in total population, fourth in Latin America and 33rd globally. Its population density of 15 persons per square kilometre of land area is well below the world average of 50 persons. The population growth rate in 2010 was an estimated 1.03% annually, with a birth rate of 17.7 live births per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 7.4 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants. Since 2010, the crude net migration rate has ranged from below zero to up to four immigrants per 1,000 inhabitants per year.[301]

        Argentina is in the midst of a demographic transition to an older and slower-growing population. The proportion of people under 15 is 25.6%, a little below the world average of 28%, and the proportion of people 65 and older is relatively high at 10.8%. In Latin America, this is second only to Uruguay and well above the world average, which is currently 7%. Argentina has a comparatively low infant mortality rate. Argentina's 2010 birth rate of 2.3 children per woman was considerably below the high of 7.0 children born per woman in 1895,[302] though still nearly twice as high as in Spain or Italy, which are culturally and demographically similar.[303][304] In 2015, the median age was 31.9 years and life expectancy at birth was 77.14 years.[305]

        Attitudes towards LGBT people are generally positive within Argentina.[306] In 2010, Argentina became the first country in Latin America, the second in the Americas, and the tenth worldwide to legalise same-sex marriage.[307][308]

        Urbanisation
        See also: List of cities in Argentina by population and List of cities in Argentina
        Argentina is highly urbanised, with 92% of its population living in cities:[309] the ten largest metropolitan areas account for half of the population. About 3 million people live in the city of Buenos Aires. The Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area has around 13 million, making it one of the largest urban areas in the world.[310] The metropolitan areas of Córdoba and Rosario have around 1.3 million inhabitants each.[310] Mendoza, San Miguel de Tucumán, La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe have at least half a million people each.[310]

        The population is unequally distributed: about 60% live in the Pampas region (21% of the total area), including 15 million people in Buenos Aires province. The provinces of Córdoba and Santa Fe, and the city of Buenos Aires have 3 million each. Seven other provinces have over one million people each: Mendoza, Tucumán, Entre Ríos, Salta, Chaco, Corrientes and Misiones. With 64.3 inhabitants per square kilometre (167/sq mi), Tucumán is the only Argentine province more densely populated than the world average. By contrast, the southern province of Santa Cruz has around 1.1/km2 (2.8/sq mi).[311]

        A crowd of Argentines from Rafaela, Santa Fe, during the 2022 World Cup.
        Argentina is considered a country of immigrants.[313][314][315] Argentines usually refer to the country as a crisol de razas (crucible of races, or melting pot). A 2010 study conducted on 218 individuals by the Argentine geneticist Daniel Corach established that the average genetic ancestry of Argentines is 79% European (mainly Italian and Spanish), 18% indigenous and 4.3% African. 63.6% of the tested group had at least one ancestor who was Indigenous.[316][317] The majority of Argentines descend from multiple European ethnic groups, primarily of Italian and Spanish descent, with over 25 million Argentines, almost 60% of the population, having some partial Italian origins.[318]

        Argentina is home to a notable Asian population, the majority of whom are descended from either West Asians, namely Lebanese and Syrians,[319] or East Asians, such as the Chinese,[320] Koreans, and the Japanese.[321] The latter of whom number around 180,000 individuals. The total number of Arab Argentines (most of whom are of Lebanese or Syrian origin) is estimated to be 1.3 to 3.5 million. Many immigrated from Asian countries to Argentina during the latter half of 19th century, and the first half of the 20th century.[322][323] Most Arab Argentines belong to the Catholic Church, including both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches, or the Eastern Orthodox Church. A minority are Muslims. In 2018, there were 180,000 Alawites in Argentina.[324][325]

        Since the 1970s, immigration has mostly been coming from Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru, with smaller numbers from the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Romania.[326] In 2008, the Argentine government estimated that 750,000 inhabitants lack official documents and has launched a programme[327] to encourage illegal immigrants to declare their status in return for two-year residence visas—so far over 670,000 applications have been processed under the programme.[328] As of July 2023, more than 18,500 Russians have come to Argentina after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.[329]

        Languages
        Main article: Languages of Argentina

        Dialectal variants of the Spanish language in Argentina
        The de facto[P] official language is Spanish, spoken by almost all Argentines.[330] Argentina is the largest Spanish-speaking society that universally employs voseo, the use of the pronoun vos instead of tú ("you"), which imposes the use of alternative verb forms as well.

        Owing to the extensive Argentine geography, Spanish has a strong variation among regions, although the prevalent dialect is Rioplatense, primarily spoken in the Pampean and Patagonian regions and accented similarly to the Neapolitan language.[331] Italian and other European immigrants influenced Lunfardo—the regional slang—permeating the vernacular vocabulary of other Latin American countries as well.

        There are several second languages in widespread use among the Argentine population: English (by 2.8 million people);[332] Italian (by 1.5 million people);[330][Q] Arabic (specifically its Northern Levantine dialect, by one million people);[330] Standard German (by 200,000 people);[330][R] Guaraní (by 200,000 people,[330] mostly in Corrientes and Misiones);[3] Catalan (by 174,000 people);[330] Quechua (by 65,000 people, mostly in the Northwest);[330] Wichí (by 53,700 people, mainly in Chaco[330] where, along with Kom and Moqoit, it is official de jure);[333] Vlax Romani (by 52,000 people);[330] Albanian (by 40,000 people);[334] Japanese (by 32,000 people);[330] Aymara (by 30,000 people, mostly in the Northwest);[330] and Ukrainian (by 27,000 people).[330]

        Religion
        Main article: Religion in Argentina

        Francis, the first pope from the Americas, was born and raised in Argentina.
        Christianity is the largest religion in Argentina. The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion.[335] Although it enforces neither an official nor a state faith,[336] it gives Roman Catholicism a preferential status.[337][S]

        In 2008, Argentines were 76.5% Catholic, 11.3% Agnostics and Atheists, 9% Evangelical Protestants, 1.2% Jehovah's Witnesses, and 0.9% Mormons, while 1.2% followed other religions, including Islam, Judaism and Buddhism.[339] These figures appear to have changed quite significantly in recent years: in 2017, Catholics were 66% of the population, indicating a drop of 10.5% in nine years, and the nonreligious in the country standing at 21% of the population, indicating an almost doubling over the same period.[340] In 2024, Catholics were 63% of the population. 20% of Argentines are irreligious, 9% are Protestants, and 8% follow another religion or didn't answer.[341]

        Argentina is home to both one of the largest Muslim[338] and largest Jewish communities in Latin America, the latter being the seventh most populous in the world.[342] Argentina is a member of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.[338]

        Argentines show high individualisation and deinstitutionalisation of religious beliefs.[343] 23.8% claim to always attend religious services; 49.1% seldom do and 26.8% never do.[344]

        On 13 March 2013, Argentine Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the Cardinal Archbishop of Buenos Aires, was elected Bishop of Rome and Supreme Pontiff of the Catholic Church. He took the name "Francis", and he became the first Pope from either the Americas or from the Southern Hemisphere. He is the first Pope born outside of Europe since the election of Pope Gregory III, who was Syrian, in 741.[345]

        Education
        Main article: Education in Argentina

        Faculty of Law of the University of Buenos Aires
        The Argentine education system consists of four levels.[346] An initial level for children between 45 days to 5 years old, with the last two years[347] being compulsory. An elementary or lower school mandatory level lasting 6 or 7 years.[T] In 2010, the literacy rate was 98.07%.[348] A secondary or high school mandatory level lasts 5 or 6 years.[T] In 2010, 38.5% of people over age 20 had completed secondary school.[349] Higher education is divided into tertiary, university and post-graduate sub-levels. In 2013, there were 47 national public universities across the country, and 46 private ones.[350]

        In 2010, 7.1% of people over age 20 had graduated from university.[349] The public universities of Buenos Aires, Córdoba, La Plata, Rosario, and the National Technological University are some of the most important. The Argentine state guarantees universal, secular and free-of-charge public education for all levels.[U] Responsibility for educational supervision is organised at the federal and individual provincial states. In the last decades the role of the private sector has grown across all educational stages.

        Health
        Main article: Health care in Argentina

        Clemente Álvarez Emergency Hospital in Rosario
        Healthcare is provided through a combination of employer and labour union-sponsored plans (Obras Sociales), government insurance plans, public hospitals and clinics and through private health insurance plans. Healthcare cooperatives number over 300 (of which 200 are related to labour unions) and provide healthcare for half the population; the national INSSJP (popularly known as PAMI) covers nearly all of the five million senior citizens.[351]

        There are more than 153,000 hospital beds, 121,000 physicians and 37,000 dentists, ratios comparable to developed nations.[352][353] The relatively high access to medical care has historically resulted in mortality patterns and trends similar to developed nations': from 1953 to 2005, deaths from cardiovascular disease increased from 20% to 23% of the total, those from tumors from 14% to 20%, respiratory problems from 7% to 14%, digestive maladies (non-infectious) from 7% to 11%, strokes a steady 7%, injuries, 6%, and infectious diseases, 4%. Causes related to senility led to many of the rest. Infant deaths have fallen from 19% of all deaths in 1953 to 3% in 2005.[352][354]

        The availability of healthcare has also reduced infant mortality from 70 per 1000 live births in 1948[355] to 12.1 in 2009[352] and raised life expectancy at birth from 60 years to 76.[355] Though these figures compare favourably with global averages, they fall short of levels in developed nations and in 2006, Argentina ranked fourth in Latin America.[353]

        Culture

        See also: List of Argentines

        The Sun of May on the first Argentine coin, 1813
        Argentina is a multicultural country with significant European influences. Modern Argentine culture has been largely influenced by Italian, Spanish and other European immigration from France, Russia, United Kingdom, among others. Its cities are largely characterised by both the prevalence of people of European descent, and of conscious imitation of American and European styles in fashion, architecture and design.[356]

        Museums, cinemas, and galleries are abundant in all the large urban centres, as well as traditional establishments such as literary bars, or bars offering live music of a variety of genres although there are lesser elements of Amerindian and African influences, particularly in the fields of music and art.[357] The other big influence is the gauchos and their traditional country lifestyle of self-reliance.[358] Indigenous American traditions have been absorbed into the general cultural milieu. Argentine writer Ernesto Sabato has reflected on the nature of the culture of Argentina as follows:

        With the primitive Hispanic American reality fractured in La Plata Basin due to immigration, its inhabitants have come to be somewhat dual with all the dangers but also with all the advantages of that condition: because of our European roots, we deeply link the nation with the enduring values of the Old World; because of our condition of Americans we link ourselves to the rest of the continent, through the folklore of the interior and the old Castilian that unifies us, feeling somehow the vocation of the Patria Grande San Martín and Bolívar once imagined.

        Literature

        Four Argentine writers. Top left to bottom right: Julio Cortázar, Victoria Ocampo, Jorge Luis Borges, and Adolfo Bioy Casares.
        Although Argentina's rich literary history began around 1550,[360] it reached full independence with Esteban Echeverría's El Matadero, a romantic landmark that played a significant role in the development of 19th century's Argentine narrative,[361] split by the ideological divide between the popular, federalist epic of José Hernández' Martín Fierro and the elitist and cultured discourse of Sarmiento's masterpiece, Facundo.[362]

        The Modernist movement advanced into the 20th century including exponents such as Leopoldo Lugones and poet Alfonsina Storni;[363] it was followed by Vanguardism, with Ricardo Güiraldes's Don Segundo Sombra as an important reference.[364]

        Jorge Luis Borges, Argentina's most acclaimed writer and one of the foremost figures in the history of literature,[365] found new ways of looking at the modern world in metaphor and philosophical debate and his influence has extended to authors all over the globe. Short stories such as Ficciones and The Aleph are among his most famous works. He was a friend and collaborator of Adolfo Bioy Casares, who wrote one of the most praised science fiction novels, The Invention of Morel.[366] Julio Cortázar, one of the leading members of the Latin American Boom and a major name in 20th century literature,[367] influenced an entire generation of writers in the Americas and Europe.[368]

        A remarkable episode in Argentine literary history is the social and literarial dialectica between the so-called Florida group, named this way because its members used to meet together at Confitería Richmond at Florida street and published in the Martín Fierro magazine, such as Jorge Luis Borges, Leopoldo Marechal, Antonio Berni (artist), among others; versus the Boedo group [es] of Roberto Arlt, César Tiempo, Homero Manzi (tango composer), that used to meet at the Café El Japonés [es] and published their works with the Editorial Claridad [es], with both the cafe and the publisher located at Boedo Avenue.

        Other highly regarded Argentine writers, poets and essayists include Estanislao del Campo, Eugenio Cambaceres, Pedro Bonifacio Palacios, Hugo Wast, Benito Lynch, Enrique Banchs, Oliverio Girondo, Ezequiel Martínez Estrada, Victoria Ocampo, Leopoldo Marechal, Silvina Ocampo, Roberto Arlt, Eduardo Mallea, Manuel Mujica Láinez, Ernesto Sábato, Silvina Bullrich, Rodolfo Walsh, María Elena Walsh, Tomás Eloy Martínez, Manuel Puig, Alejandra Pizarnik, and Osvaldo Soriano.[369]

        Music

        Tango, a Rioplatense musical genre with European and African influences,[370] is one of Argentina's international cultural symbols.[371] The golden age of tango, from 1930 to the mid-1950s, mirrored that of jazz and swing in the United States, featuring large orchestras such as those of Osvaldo Pugliese, Aníbal Troilo, Francisco Canaro, Julio de Caro and Juan d'Arienzo.[372] After 1955, virtuoso Astor Piazzolla popularised Nuevo tango, a subtler and more intellectual trend for the genre.[372] Tango enjoys worldwide popularity nowadays with groups such as Gotan Project, Bajofondo and Tanghetto.

        Argentina developed strong classical music and dance scenes that gave rise to renowned artists such as Alberto Ginastera, composer; Alberto Lysy, violinist; Martha Argerich and Eduardo Delgado, pianists; Daniel Barenboim, pianist and symphonic orchestra director; José Cura and Marcelo Álvarez, tenors; and to ballet dancers Jorge Donn, José Neglia, Norma Fontenla, Maximiliano Guerra, Paloma Herrera, Marianela Núñez, Iñaki Urlezaga and Julio Bocca.[372]

        A national Argentine folk style emerged in the 1930s from dozens of regional musical genres and went on to influence the entirety of Latin American music. Some of its interpreters, such as Atahualpa Yupanqui and Mercedes Sosa, achieved worldwide acclaim. The romantic ballad genre included singers of international fame such as Sandro de América. Tenor saxophonist Leandro "Gato" Barbieri and composer and big band conductor Lalo Schifrin are among the most internationally successful Argentine jazz musicians.

        Argentine rock developed as a distinct musical style in the mid-1960s, when Buenos Aires and Rosario became cradles of aspiring musicians. Founding bands such as Los Gatos, Sui Generis, Almendra and Manal were followed by Seru Giran, Los Abuelos de la Nada, Soda Stereo and Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, with prominent artists including Gustavo Cerati, Litto Nebbia, Andrés Calamaro, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Charly García, Fito Páez and León Gieco.[372]

        A dance and a musical genre popular at present is Cachengue, a subgenre of Argentine cumbia and reggaeton spreading in popularity in nearby countries such as Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, and Bolivia.[373]

        Buenos Aires is one of the great theatre capitals of the world,[376] with a scene of international caliber centred on Corrientes Avenue, "the street that never sleeps", sometimes referred to as the Broadway of Buenos Aires.[377] Teatro Colón is a global landmark for opera and classical performances; its acoustics are considered among the world's top five.[378][V]

        The Argentine film industry has historically been one of the three most developed in Latin American cinema, along with those produced in Mexico and Brazil.[379][380] It started in 1896. By the early 1930s, it was Latin America's leading film producer, a place it kept until the early 1950s.[381] The world's first animated feature films were made and released in Argentina, by cartoonist Quirino Cristiani, in 1917 and 1918.[382]

        Argentine films have achieved worldwide recognition: Argentina has won two Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, for The Official Story (1985) and The Secret in Their Eyes (2009). Argentine composers Luis Enrique Bacalov and Gustavo Santaolalla have been honoured with Academy Awards for Best Original Score, and Armando Bó and Nicolás Giacobone shared in the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for 2014.

        The Argentine French actress Bérénice Bejo received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2011 and won the César Award for Best Actress and won the Best Actress award in the Cannes Film Festival for her role in the film The Past.[383] Argentina has won seventeen Goya Awards for Best Spanish Language Foreign Film, being by far the most awarded country in Latin America with twenty-four nominations. Many other Argentine films have been acclaimed by international critique. In 2013, about 100 full-length motion pictures were being created annually.[384]

        Visual arts and architecture
        See also: Argentine painting and Architecture of Argentina

        Some of the best-known Argentine painters are Cándido López and Florencio Molina Campos (Naïve style); Ernesto de la Cárcova and Eduardo Sívori (Realism); Fernando Fader (Impressionism); Pío Collivadino, Atilio Malinverno and Cesáreo Bernaldo de Quirós (Postimpressionism); Emilio Pettoruti (Cubism); Julio Barragán (Concretism and Cubism) Antonio Berni (Neofigurativism); Roberto Aizenberg and Xul Solar (Surrealism); Gyula Košice (Constructivism); Eduardo Mac Entyre (Generative art); Luis Seoane, Carlos Torrallardona, Luis Aquino, Alfredo Gramajo Gutiérrez (Modernism); Lucio Fontana (Spatialism); Tomás Maldonado, Guillermo Kuitca (Abstract art); León Ferrari, Marta Minujín (Conceptual art); Gustavo Cabral (Fantasy art), and Fabián Pérez (Neoemotionalism).[vague]

        In 1946, Gyula Košice and others created The Madí Movement in Argentina, which then spread to Europe and the United States, where it had a significant impact.[385] Tomás Maldonado was one of the main theorists of the Ulm Model of design education, still highly influential globally. Other Argentine artists of worldwide fame include Adolfo Bellocq, whose lithographs have been influential since the 1920s, and Benito Quinquela Martín, the quintessential port painter, inspired by the immigrant-bound La Boca neighbourhood. Internationally laureate sculptors Erminio Blotta, Lola Mora and Rogelio Yrurtia authored many of the classical evocative monuments of the Argentine cityscape.[citation needed]

        The colonisation brought the Spanish Baroque architecture, which can still be appreciated in its simpler Rioplatense style in the reduction of San Ignacio Miní, the Cathedral of Córdoba, and the Cabildo of Luján. Italian and French influences increased at the beginning of the 19th century with strong eclectic overtones that gave the local architecture a unique feeling.[386]

        Mass media
        Main article: Communications in Argentina

        Headquarters of the Channel 7, the first television station in the country
        The print media industry is highly developed in Argentina, with more than two hundred newspapers. The major national ones include Clarín (centrist, Latin America's best-seller and the second most widely circulated in the Spanish-speaking world), La Nación (centre-right), Página/12 (leftist), La Voz del Interior (centre).[387][388]

        Argentina began the world's first regular radio broadcasting on 27 August 1920, when Richard Wagner's Parsifal was aired by a team of medical students led by Enrique Telémaco Susini in Buenos Aires' Teatro Coliseo.[389] In 2002, there were 260 AM and 1150 FM registered radio stations in Argentina.[390]

        The Argentine television industry is large, diverse and popular across Latin America, with many productions and TV formats having been exported abroad. Since 1999 Argentines have enjoyed the highest availability of cable and satellite television in Latin America.[391] In 2014, 87.4% of Argentina's households had access, a rate similar to those in the United States, Canada and Europe.[392]

        In 2011, Argentina had the highest coverage of networked telecommunications among Latin American powers: about 67% of its population had internet access and the ratio of mobile phone subscriptions to population was 137.2%.[393][better source needed]

        Besides many of the pasta, sausage and dessert dishes common to continental Europe, Argentines enjoy a wide variety of Indigenous and Criollo creations, including empanadas (a small stuffed pastry), locro (a mixture of corn, beans, meat, bacon, onion, and gourd), humita and mate.[394]

        The country has the highest consumption of red meat in the world,[395] traditionally prepared as asado, the Argentine barbecue. It is made with various types of meats, often including chorizo, sweetbread, chitterlings, and blood sausage.[396]

        Common desserts include facturas (Viennese-style pastry), cakes and pancakes filled with dulce de leche (a sort of milk caramel jam), alfajores (shortbread cookies sandwiched together with chocolate, dulce de leche or a fruit paste), and tortas fritas (fried cakes)[397]

        Argentine wine, one of the world's finest,[398] is an integral part of the local menu. Malbec, Torrontés, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Chardonnay are some of the most sought-after varieties.[399]

        Sport
        Main article: Sport in Argentina

        Footballer Lionel Messi, eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, is the current captain of the Argentina national football team.
        Pato is the national sport,[400] an ancient horseback game locally originated in the early 1600s and predecessor of horseball.[401][402]

        The most popular sport is football. Along with Brazil, Germany and France, the men's national team is the only one to have won each of the World Cup (in 1978, 1986 and 2022), Confederations Cup, and the Olympic gold. They have also won 16 Copas América, 7 Pan American Gold Medals and many other trophies.[403] Alfredo Di Stéfano, Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi are widely considered to be among the best players in the game's history.[404]

        The country's women's field hockey team Las Leonas, is one of the world's most successful with four Olympic medals, two World Cups, a World League and seven Champions Trophy.[405] Luciana Aymar is recognised as the best female player in the history of the sport,[406] being the only player to have received the FIH Player of the Year Award eight times.[407]

        Basketball is a very popular sport. The men's national team is the only one in the FIBA Americas zone that has won the quintuplet crown: World Championship, Olympic Gold Medal, Diamond Ball, Americas Championship, and Pan American Gold Medal. It has also conquered 13 South American Championships, and many other tournaments.[408] Emanuel Ginóbili, Luis Scola, Andrés Nocioni, Fabricio Oberto, Pablo Prigioni, Carlos Delfino and Juan Ignacio Sánchez are a few of the country's most acclaimed players, all of them part of the NBA.[405] Argentina hosted the Basketball World Cup in 1950 and 1990.

        Rugby is another popular sport in Argentina. As of 2017, the men's national team, known as 'Los Pumas' has competed at the Rugby World Cup each time it has been held, achieving their highest-ever result in 2007 when they came third. Since 2012, the Los Pumas have competed against Australia, New Zealand & South Africa in The Rugby Championship, the premier international Rugby competition in the Southern Hemisphere. Since 2009 the secondary men's national team known as the 'Jaguares' has competed against the US, Canada, and Uruguay first teams in the Americas Rugby Championship, which Los Jaguares have won six out of eight times it has taken place.


        Argentine Polo Open Championship
        Argentina has produced some of the most formidable champions for boxing, including Carlos Monzón, the best middleweight in history;[409] Pascual Pérez, one of the most decorated flyweight boxers of all times; Horacio Accavallo, the former WBA and WBC world flyweight champion; Víctor Galíndez, as of 2009, record holder for consecutive world light heavyweight title defences and Nicolino Locche, nicknamed "The Untouchable" for his masterful defence; they are all inductees into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.[410]

        Tennis has been quite popular among people of all ages. Guillermo Vilas is the greatest Latin American player of the Open Era,[411] while Gabriela Sabatini is the most accomplished Argentine female player of all time—having reached number 3 in the WTA ranking,[412] are both inductees into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.[413] Argentina has won the World Team Cup four times, in 1980, 2002, 2007 and 2010 and has reached the semifinals of the Davis Cup 7 times in the last 10 years, losing the finals against Russia in 2006 and Spain in 2008 and 2011; the Argentine team also played the final in 1981, where they lost against the United States. The national squad won the 2016 Davis Cup.

        Argentina reigns undisputed in polo, having won more international championships than any other country and been seldom beaten since the 1930s.[414] The Argentine Polo Championship is the sport's most important international team trophy. The country is home to most of the world's top players, among them Adolfo Cambiaso, the best in Polo history.[415]

        Historically, Argentina has had a strong showing within auto racing. Juan Manuel Fangio was a five-time Formula One world champion under four different teams, winning 102 of his 184 international races, and is widely ranked as the greatest driver of all time.[416] Other distinguished racers were Oscar Alfredo Gálvez, Juan Gálvez, José Froilán González and Carlos Reutemann.[417]

        <p>India, officially the Republic of India,[j][20] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country since 2023;[21] and, since its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy.[22][23][24] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[k] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is near Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Myanmar, Thailand, and Indonesia.

        Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[26][27][28] Their long occupation, predominantly in isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse.[29] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[30] By 1200 BC, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[31][32] Its hymns recorded the early dawnings of Hinduism in India.[33] India's pre-existing Dravidian languages were supplanted in the northern regions.[34] By 400 BC, caste had emerged within Hinduism,[35] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[36] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires.[37] Widespread creativity suffused this era,[38] but the status of women declined,[39] and untouchability became an organised belief.[l][40] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian language scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[41]

        In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts.[42] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains in the second millennium.[43] The resulting Delhi Sultanate drew northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[44] In south India, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture.[45] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[46] The Mughal Empire ushered in two centuries of economic expansion and relative peace,[47] leaving a rich architectural legacy.[48][49] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company turned India into a colonial economy but consolidated its sovereignty.[50] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[51][52] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root.[53] A nationalist movement emerged in India, the first in the non-European British Empire and an influence on other nationalist movements.[54][55] Noted for nonviolent resistance after 1920,[56] it became the primary factor in ending British rule.[57] In 1947, the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[58][59][60][61] a Hindu-majority dominion of India and a Muslim-majority dominion of Pakistan. A large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration accompanied the partition.[62]

        India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to over 1.4 billion in 2023.[63] During this time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. A comparatively destitute country in 1951,[64] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[65] Indian movies and music increasingly influence global culture.[66] India has reduced its poverty rate, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[67] It is a nuclear-weapon state that ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[68] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[69] and rising levels of air pollution.[70] India's land is megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots.[71] India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in its culture,[72] is supported in protected habitats.

        Etymology
        Main article: Names for India
        According to the Oxford English Dictionary (2009), the name "India" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east. In turn, "India" derived successively from Hellenistic Greek India (Ἰνδία), Ancient Greek Indos (Ἰνδός), Old Persian Hindush (an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire), and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or 'river'—specifically the Indus River, and by extension its well-settled southern basin.[73][74] The Ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi, 'the people of the Indus'.[75]


        Hāthigumphā inscription of King Kharavela (2nd century BCE), containing one of the earliest known references to the name 'Bharat' for India
        The term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] ⓘ), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[76][77] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to North India,[78][79] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[76][80]

        Hindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] ⓘ) is a Middle Persian name for India that became popular by the 13th century,[81] and was used widely since the era of the Mughal Empire. The meaning of Hindustan has varied, referring to a region encompassing the northern Indian subcontinent (present-day northern India and Pakistan) or to India in its near entirety.[76][80][82]

        History
        Main article: History of India
        Ancient India

        Manuscript illustration, c. 1650, of the Sanskrit epic Ramayana, composed in story-telling fashion c. 400 BC – c. 300 CE[83]
        55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa.[26][27][28] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[26] After 6500 BC, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.[84] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[85][84] the first urban culture in South Asia,[86] which flourished during 2500–1900 BC in Pakistan and western India.[87] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[86]

        During the period 2000–500 BC, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[88] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[89] were composed during this period,[90] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[88] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[89] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[91] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[88] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[92] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[92]


        Cave 26 of the rock-cut Ajanta Caves
        In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[93][94] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[95] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[96][97][98]

        In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[99] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Maurya Empire.[100] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[101][102] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[103][104]

        The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BC and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and Southeast Asia.[105][106] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[107][100] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[108][109] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[110] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[109] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[109]

        The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[111] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[112] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[112] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[112] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[111] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[113] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[113]

        In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[114] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[114] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[115] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[115] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[116] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[116]

        After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[117] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[118][119]

        By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[120][121] The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[122] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[123] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[122]

        Early modern India

        In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[124] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[125] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[126][127] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[128] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[129] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[128]

        The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[130] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[131] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[129] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,[129] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[132] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[133] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[133] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[134]

        By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[135][136] The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[137][135][138][139] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[140] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.[135] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture.[141]

        Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[142][143][144][145] Disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[146][147]

        Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[148][149] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[150][151][152][153]

        The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[154] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[155] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[156] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[157] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[158] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[158] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[157]

        After World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[159] a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mahatma Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[160] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[161] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.[162]

        Vital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic.[163] Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1980s and with the collaboration with Soviet Union for technical knowledge,[164] has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world's fastest-growing economies,[165] and increased its geopolitical influence. Yet, India is also shaped by persistent poverty, both rural and urban;[166] by religious and caste-related violence;[167] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[168] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India.[169] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China and with Pakistan.[170] India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.[171] As of 2025, poverty in India declined sharply, mainly due to government welfare programs.[172]

        Geography

        India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[174] India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[174] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[174] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[174] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[175] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[176] The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis.[177][178][179]

        The remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east.[180] To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats;[181] the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35° 30′ north latitude[m] and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude.[182]

        India's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.[183] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.[183] Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal.[184]

        Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi. The Kosi's extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes.[185][186] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;[187] and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea.[188] Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.[189] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.[190]

        Climate

        The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons.[191] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.[192][193] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.[191]

        Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.[194] Temperatures in India have risen by 0.7 °C (1.3 °F) between 1901 and 2018.[195] Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.[196] According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.[197]

        Biodiversity
        Main articles: Forestry in India and Wildlife of India

        India has the majority of the world's wild tigers, approximately 3,170 in 2022.[198]

        Three of the last Asiatic cheetahs in India were shot dead in 1948 in Surguja district, Madhya Pradesh, Central India, by Maharajah Ramanuj Pratap Singh Deo. The young male cheetahs, all from the same litter, were sitting together when they were shot at night.
        India is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries that display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[199] India is the habitat for 8.6% of all mammals, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[200][201] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.[202] India also contains four of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots,[71] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[o][203]

        India's most dense forests, such as the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India, occupy approximately 3% of its land area.[204][205] Moderately dense forest, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India's land area.[204][205] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India.[206] India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible.[207] Among the Indian subcontinent's notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica, or neem, which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine,[208] and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa, or peepul,[209] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro,[210] and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.[211]

        Many Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago.[212] India's subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[213] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographic passes flanking the Himalayas.[214] This lowered endemism among India's mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[201] Among endemics are the vulnerable[215] hooded leaf monkey[216] and the threatened Beddome's toad[217][218] of the Western Ghats.

        India contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms.[219] These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include the gharial, a crocodilian; the great Indian bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle.[220] Before they were extensively used for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct.[221] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act[222] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988.[223] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and eighteen biosphere reserves,[224] four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; its eighty-nine wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[225]

        US president Barack Obama addresses the members of the Parliament of India in New Delhi in November 2010.
        India is a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system.[227] It has six recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and over 50 regional parties.[228] Congress is considered the ideological centre in Indian political culture,[229] whereas the BJP is right-wing to far-right.[230][231][232] From 1950 to the late 1980s, Congress held a majority in India's parliament. Afterwards, it increasingly shared power with the BJP,[233] as well as with powerful regional parties, which forced multi-party coalition governments at the centre.[234]

        In the general elections in 1951, 1957, and 1962, Congress, led by Jawaharlal Nehru, won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded in 1966, by Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi, who led the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency Indira Gandhi had declared in 1975, Congress was voted out of power in 1977; Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted two years; Morarji Desai and Charan Singh served as prime ministers. After Congress was returned to power in 1980, Indira Gandhi was assassinated and succeeded by Rajiv Gandhi, who won comfortably in the elections later that year. A National Front coalition led by the Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front won the 1989 elections, with the subsequent government lasting just under two years, and V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar serving as prime ministers.[235] In the 1991 Indian general election, Congress, as the largest single party, formed a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.[236]

        After the 1996 Indian general election, the BJP formed a government briefly; it was followed by United Front coalitions, which depended on external political support. Two prime ministers served during this period: H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. In 1998, the BJP formed a coalition—the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term.[237] In the 2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute majority. Still, the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India's communist parties.[238] Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.[239] In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win an absolute majority.[240] In the 2019 general election, the BJP regained an absolute majority. In the 2024 general election, a BJP-led NDA coalition formed the government. Narendra Modi, a former chief minister of Gujarat, is in his third term as the prime minister of India and has served in the position since 26 May 2014.[241]

        Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India, was designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker for the Viceroy of India, and constructed between 1911 and 1931 during the British Raj.[242]
        India is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India. Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states. India's form of government, traditionally described as "quasi-federal" with a strong centre and weak states,[243] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.[244][245]

        The Government of India comprises three branches: the Executive, Legislature, and Judiciary.[246] The President of India is the ceremonial head of state,[247] who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an electoral college comprising members of national and state legislatures.[248][249] The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive power.[250] Appointed by the president,[251] the prime minister is supported by the party or political alliance with a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.[250] The executive of the Indian government consists of the president, the vice-president, and the Union Council of Ministers—with the cabinet being its executive committee—headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament.[247] In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the executive are implemented by them.[252]

        The legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. Operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of the People).[253] The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245 members who serve staggered six-year terms with elections every 2 years.[254] Most are elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population.[251] The Lok Sabha's 543 members are elected directly by popular vote among citizens aged at least 18;[255] they represent single-member constituencies for five-year terms.[256] Several seats from each state are reserved for candidates from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population within that state.[255]

        India has a three-tier unitary independent judiciary[257] comprising the supreme court, headed by the Chief Justice of India, 25 high courts, and a large number of trial courts.[257] The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high courts.[258] It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution[259] and invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.[260]

        India is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.[12] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[261] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.[262]

        In the 1950s and 60s, India played a pivotal role in the Non-Aligned Movement.[263] From left to right: Gamal Abdel Nasser of United Arab Republic (now Egypt), Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia and Jawaharlal Nehru in Belgrade, September 1961.
        India became a republic in 1950, remaining a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.[264][265] India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia in the 1950s; it played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement.[266] After initially cordial relations, India suffered a humiliating military defeat to China in a 1962 war.[267] Another military conflict followed in 1967 in which India successfully repelled a Chinese attack.[268]

        India has had uneasy relations with its western neighbour, Pakistan. The two countries went to war in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir. In contrast, the 1971 war followed India's support for the independence of Bangladesh.[269] After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union. By the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[270] India has played a key role in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has supplied 100,000 military and police personnel in 35 UN peacekeeping operations.[citation needed]

        China's nuclear test of 1964 and threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war caused India to produce nuclear weapons.[271] India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out additional underground testing in 1998. India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.[272] India maintains a "no first use" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its "Minimum Credible Deterrence" doctrine.[273][274]

        Since the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military cooperation with the United States and the European Union.[275] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce; India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[276] France,[277] the United Kingdom,[278] and Canada.[279]

        The President of India is the supreme commander of the nation's armed forces. With 1.45 million active troops, they are the world's second-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard.[281] The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03 billion, or 1.83% of GDP.[282] Defence expenditure was pegged at US$70.12 billion for fiscal year 2022–23 and, increased 9.8% on the previous fiscal year.[283][284] India is the world's second-largest arms importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total global arms imports.[285] Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.[286]

        Economy
        Main article: Economy of India

        In 2019, 43% of India's total workforce was employed in agriculture.[287]

        India is the world's largest producer of milk, with the largest population of cattle. In 2018, nearly 80% of India's milk was sourced from small farms with herd size between one and two, the milk harvested by hand milking.[289]

        55% of India's female workforce was employed in agriculture in 2019.[288]
        According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2024 was nominally worth $3.94 trillion; it is the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates and is, at around $15.0 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).[16] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012,[290] India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies.[291] However, due to its low GDP per capita—which ranks 136th in the world in nominal per capita income and 125th in per capita income adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP)—the vast majority of Indians fall into the low-income group.[292][293]

        Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[294] since then, it has moved increasingly towards a free-market system[295][296] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[297] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.[298]

        The 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world's second largest, as of 2017.[281] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India's foreign exchange remittances of US$100 billion in 2022,[299] highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries.[300] In 2006, the share of external trade in India's GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[295] In 2008, India's share of world trade was 1.7%;[301] In 2021, India was the world's ninth-largest importer and the sixteenth-largest exporter.[302] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.[303] India was the world's second-largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year.[304]

        Averaging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years before 2007,[295] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century.[305] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India's middle classes are projected to number around 580 million by 2030.[306] In 2024, India's consumer market was the world's third largest.[307] India's nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$2,731 in 2024. It is expected to grow to US$3,264 by 2026.[16]

        Industries

        The Indian automotive industry, the world's second-fastest growing, increased domestic sales by 26% during 2009–2010,[308] and exports by 36% during 2008–2009.[309] In 2022, India became the world's third-largest vehicle market after China and the United States, surpassing Japan.[310] At the end of 2011, the Indian IT industry employed 2.8 million professionals, generated revenues close to US$100 billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP, and contributed 26% of India's merchandise exports.[311]

        The pharmaceutical industry in India includes 3,000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500 manufacturing units; India is the world's third-largest pharmaceutical producer, largest producer of generic medicines and supply up to 50–60% of global vaccines demand, these all contribute up to US$24.44 billions in exports and India's local pharmaceutical market is estimated up to US$42 billion.[312][313] India is among the top 12 biotech destinations in the world.[314][315] The Indian biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012–2013, increasing its revenues from ₹204.4 billion (Indian rupees) to ₹235.24 billion (US$3.94 billion at June 2013 exchange rates).[316]

        India's capacity to generate electrical power is 300 gigawatts, of which 42 gigawatts is renewable.[317] The country's usage of coal is a major cause of India's greenhouse gas emissions, but its renewable energy is competing strongly.[318][better source needed] India emits about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This equates to about 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half the world average.[319][320] Increasing access to electricity and clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for energy in India.[321]

        Despite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the largest number of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day.[323] The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005.[324] Under the World Bank's later revised poverty line, it was 21%-22.5 in 2011.[p][326][327] In 2019, the estimates had gone down to 10.2%.[327] In 2014, 30.7% of India's children under the age of five were underweight.[328] According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population was undernourished.[329][330] The Midday Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates.[331]

        A 2018 Walk Free Foundation report estimated that nearly 8 million people in India were living in different forms of modern slavery, such as bonded labour, child labour, human trafficking, and forced begging.[332] According to the 2011 census, there were 10.1 million child labourers in the country, a decline of 2.6 million from 12.6 million in 2001.[333]

        Since 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest.[334] Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018, an improvement from 85th in 2014.[335][336]

        As of 2025, poverty in India declined sharply. According to the World Bank report, extreme poverty fall from 16.2% in 2011-12 to 2.3% in 2022-23. In rural areas it fell from 18.4% to 2.8%, and in urban areas, from 10.7% to 1.1%. 378 million peopole were lifted from poverty and 171 million from extreme poverty. The main reason, according to the World Bank, is not economic growth but different government welfare programs, like transferring food and money to the people with low income, improving their access to services.[172]

        With an estimated 1,428,627,663 residents in 2023, India is the world's most populous country.[13] 1,210,193,422 residents were reported in the 2011 provisional census report.[337] Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011,[338] compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991–2001).[338] The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males.[337] The median age was 28.7 in 2020.[281]

        The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361 million people.[339] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the "Green Revolution" have caused India's population to grow rapidly.[340] The life expectancy in India is 70 years to 71.5 years for women, and 68.7 years for men.[281] There are around 93 physicians per 100,000 people.[341]

        Urbanisation
        Main article: Urbanisation in India
        Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India's recent history. The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001.[342] In 2001, over 70% lived in rural areas.[343][344] The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 census to 31.16% in the 2011 census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991.[345] In the 2011 census, there were 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India. Among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population.[346]

        Languages
        Main article: Languages of India
        Among speakers of the Indian languages, 74% speak Indo-Aryan languages (the easternmost branch of the Indo-European languages), 24% speak Dravidian languages (indigenous to South Asia and spoken widely before the spread of Indo-Aryan languages), and 2% speak Austroasiatic languages or the Sino-Tibetan languages. India has no national language.[347] Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government.[348][349] English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a "subsidiary official language";[6] it is important in education, especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 "scheduled languages".

        Religion
        Main article: Religion in India
        The 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by Islam (14.23%); the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and others[q] (0.9%).[11] India has the third-largest Muslim population—the largest for a non-Muslim majority country.[350][351]

        The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males.[352] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas.[345] Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%.[352] In the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951, the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921, the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891, they were 5%, 9% and 1%,[353][354] According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth.[355]

        The education system of India is the world's second-largest.[356] India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges[357] and 1.5 million schools.[358] In India's higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[359][360]

        The life expectancy at birth has increased from 49.7 years in 1970–1975 to 72.0 years in 2023.[361][362] The under-five mortality rate for the country was 113 per 1,000 live births in 1994 whereas in 2018 it reduced to 41.1 per 1,000 live births.[361]

        India bears a disproportionately large burden of the world's tuberculosis rates, with World Health Organization (WHO) statistics for 2022 estimating 2.8 million new infections annually, accounting for 26% of the global total.[363] It is estimated that approximately 40% of the population of India carry tuberculosis infection.[364]

        In 2018 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was the leading cause of death after heart disease. The 10 most polluted cities in the world are all in northern India with more than 140 million people breathing air 10 times or more over the WHO safe limit. In 2017, air pollution killed 1.24 million Indians.[365]

        The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or "castes".[366] India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.[r] However, the system continues to be dominant in India, and caste-based inequality, discrimination, segregation, and violence persist.[368][369]

        Multi-generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.[370] An overwhelming majority of Indians have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders.[371] Marriage is thought to be for life,[371] and the divorce rate is extremely low,[372] with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.[373] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.[374] Female infanticide in India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63 million in the 50 years ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period.[375] According to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care.[376] Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society.[377] The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines.[378] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.[379]

        Visual art
        Main article: Indian art
        India has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[380] Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley civilisation of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but also some with human figures. The Pashupati seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known.[381][382] After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[382][383] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement.[384][385][386]

        In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[387] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing prana ("breath" or life-force).[388][389] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.[390][391]

        Most of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati,[392] or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.[393][394] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.[395] Gupta art, at its peak c. 300 CE – c. 500 CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves.[396][397] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c. 800 CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[398] But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.[399][400]

        Ancient paintings have only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are some of the most important.[401][402] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India from 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. These significantly influenced later artistic styles.[403] The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[404][405] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh.[406][407] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence.[408][409] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern Indian painting.[410][411]

        Women in sari at an adult literacy class in Tamil Nadu

        Women (from left to right) in churidars and kameez (with back to the camera), jeans and sweater, and pink shalwar kameez
        From ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped.[412] For women it took the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long.[412] The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder.[412] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end—passing over the shoulder—covering the midriff and obscuring the upper body's contours.[412] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[413]

        The use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate (c. 1300 CE) and then continued by the Mughal Empire (c. 1525 CE).[414] Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez.[414] In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.[414]

        Salwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist.[415] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[416] its side seams left open below the waistline.[417] The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikankari; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer's knees.[418]

        In the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[419] The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans.[419] In office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[419] For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle and upper classes often wear Jodhpuri bandhgala, or short Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars.[419] The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[420] is seldom seen in the cities.[419]

        Cuisine

        South Indian vegetarian thali, or platter
        The foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked plainly and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[421] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread;[422] the idli, a steamed breakfast cake; or dosa, a griddled pancake.[423] The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others.[421] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients may be mixed during the cooking process.[424]

        A platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping—such as chapati and cooked vegetables.[421]

        A tandoor chef in the Turkman Gate, Old Delhi, makes Khameeri roti (a Muslim-influenced style of leavened bread).[425]
        India has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[426] About 20% to 39% of India's population consists of vegetarians.[427][428] Much of this stems from caste hierarchy, as upper castes, such as the Brahmins, consider vegetarian food to be "pure".[429][430] Although meat is eaten widely in India, the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.[431] Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption.[432]

        The most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the pilaf,[433] developed in the Abbasid caliphate,[434] and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[435] To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India.[435] Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become biryani,[435] a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[436]

        In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide, the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine. The popularity of tandoori chicken—cooked in the tandoor oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from Central Asia—dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition.[426]

Chess is commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaṅga;[438] in recent years,[when?] there has been a rise in the number of Indian grandmasters[439] and world champions.[440] Parcheesi is derived from Pachisi, another traditional Indian pastime, which in early modern times was played on a giant marble court by Mughal emperor Akbar.[441]

        Cricket is the most popular sport in India.[442] India is one of the most successful cricket teams in the world, having won two Cricket World Cups, two T20 World Cups, three Champions Trophies, and finished as runners-up twice in the World Test Championship. India has won a record eight field hockey gold medals in the summer Olympics.[443]

        <p>Brazil,[c] officially the Federative Republic of Brazil,[d] is the largest country in South America. It is also the world's fifth-largest country by area and the seventh-largest by population, with over 213 million people. The country is a federation composed of 26 states and a Federal District, which hosts the capital, Brasília. Its most populous city is São Paulo, followed by Rio de Janeiro. Brazil has the most Portuguese speakers in the world and is the only country in the Americas where Portuguese is an official language.[11][12]

        Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers (4,655 mi).[13] Covering roughly half of South America's land area, it borders all other countries and territories on the continent except Ecuador and Chile.[14] Brazil encompasses a wide range of tropical and subtropical landscapes, as well as wetlands, savannas, plateaus, and low mountains. It contains most of the Amazon basin, including the world's largest river system and most extensive virgin tropical forest. Brazil has diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats.[13] The country ranks first among 17 megadiverse countries, with its natural heritage being the subject of significant global interest, as environmental degradation (through processes such as deforestation) directly affect global issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss.

        Brazil was inhabited by various indigenous peoples prior to the landing of Portuguese explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral in 1500. It was claimed and settled by Portugal, which imported enslaved Africans to work on plantations. Brazil remained a colony until 1815, when it was elevated to the rank of a united kingdom with Portugal after the transfer of the Portuguese court to Rio de Janeiro. Prince Pedro of Braganza declared the country's independence in 1822 and, after waging a war against Portugal, established the Empire of Brazil. Brazil's first constitution in 1824 established a bicameral legislature, now called the National Congress, and enshrined principles such as freedom of religion and the press, but retained slavery, which was gradually abolished throughout the 19th century until its final abolition in 1888. Brazil became a presidential republic following a military coup d'état in 1889. An armed revolution in 1930 put an end to the First Republic and brought Getúlio Vargas to power. While initially committing to democratic governance, Vargas assumed dictatorial powers following a self-coup in 1937, marking the beginning of the Estado Novo, in which he oversaw Brazil's involvement in World War II. Democracy was restored after Vargas' ousting in 1945. An authoritarian military dictatorship emerged in 1964 with support from the United States and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. Brazil's current constitution, enacted in 1988, defines it as a democratic federal republic.[15]

        Brazil is a regional and middle power[16][17][18] and rising global power.[19][20][21][22] It is an emerging,[23][24] upper-middle income economy and newly industrialized country,[25] with one of the 10 largest economies in the world in both nominal and PPP terms,[7][26] the largest economy in Latin America and the Southern Hemisphere, and the largest share of wealth in South America. With a complex and highly diversified economy, Brazil is one of the world's major or primary exporters of various agricultural goods, mineral resources, and manufactured products.[27] The country ranks thirteenth in the world by number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[28] Brazil is a founding member of the United Nations, the G20, BRICS, G4, Mercosur, Organization of American States, Organization of Ibero-American States, and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries; it is also an observer state of the Arab League and a major non-NATO ally of the United States.[29][30]

        Etymology
        Main article: Name of Brazil
        The word Brazil probably comes from the Portuguese word for brazilwood, a tree that once grew plentifully along the Brazilian coast.[31] In Portuguese, brazilwood is called pau-brasil, with the word brasil commonly given the etymology 'red like an ember', formed from brasa ('ember') and the suffix -il (from -iculum or -ilium).[32] It has alternatively been suggested that this is a folk etymology for a word for the plant related to an Arabic or Asian word for a red plant.[33] As brazilwood produces a deep red dye, it was highly valued by the European textile industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from Brazil.[34] Throughout the 16th century, massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by indigenous peoples (mostly Tupi) along the Brazilian coast, who sold the timber to European traders in return for assorted European consumer goods.[35]

        The official Portuguese name of the land, in original Portuguese records, was the 'Land of the Holy Cross' (Terra da Santa Cruz),[36] but European sailors and merchants commonly called it the 'Land of Brazil' (Terra do Brasil) because of the brazilwood trade.[37] Popular usage eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official Portuguese name. Some early sailors called it the 'Land of Parrots'.[38] In the Guarani language, Brazil is called Pindorama, meaning 'land of the palm trees'.[39]

        Some of the earliest human remains found in the Americas, Luzia Woman, were found in the area of Pedro Leopoldo, Minas Gerais, and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years.[41] The earliest pottery ever found in the Western Hemisphere was excavated in the Amazon basin of Brazil and radiocarbon dated to over 8,000 years ago (6000 BC). The pottery was found near Santarém and provides evidence that the region supported a complex prehistoric culture.[42] The Marajoara culture flourished on Marajó in the Amazon delta from AD 400 to 1400, developing sophisticated pottery, social stratification, large populations, mound building, and complex social formations such as chiefdoms.[43]

        Around the time of the Portuguese arrival, the territory of present day Brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people,[44] mostly semi-nomadic, who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migrant agriculture. The population comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups (e.g., the Tupis, Guaranis, Gês, and Arawaks). The Tupi people were subdivided into the Tupiniquins and Tupinambás.[45]

        Before the arrival of the Europeans, the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture, language and moral beliefs.[46] These wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water, with cannibalistic rituals on prisoners of war.[47][48] While heredity had some weight, leadership was a status more won over time than assigned in succession ceremonies and conventions.[46] Slavery among the indigenous groups had a different meaning than it had for Europeans, since it originated from a diverse socioeconomic organization, in which asymmetries were translated into kinship relations.[49]

        Portuguese colonization

        Execution of the Punishment of the Whip by Jean-Baptiste Debret. Nearly 5 million enslaved Africans were imported to Brazil during the Atlantic slave trade, more than any country.[50]
        Following the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, the land now called Brazil was claimed for the Portuguese Empire on 22 April 1500, with the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by Pedro Álvares Cabral.[51] The Portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several ethnic societies, most of whom spoke languages of the Tupi–Guarani family and fought among themselves.[52] Though the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization effectively began in 1534, when King John III of Portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous captaincies.[53][54]

        However, the decentralized and unorganized captaincy system proved problematic, and in 1549 the Portuguese king restructured them into the Governorate General of Brazil in the city of Salvador, which became the capital of a single and centralized Portuguese colony in South America.[54][55] In the first two centuries of colonization, Indigenous and European groups lived in constant war, establishing opportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other.[56][57][58][59]

        By the mid-16th century, cane sugar had become Brazil's most important export,[52][60] while slaves purchased in Sub-Saharan Africa in the slave market of Western Africa[61] (not only those from Portuguese allies of their colonies in Angola and Mozambique), had become its largest import,[62][63] to cope with sugarcane plantations, due to increasing international demand for Brazilian sugar.[64][65] Brazil received more than 2.8 million slaves from Africa between the years 1500 and 1800.[66]

        By the end of the 17th century, sugar exports began to decline[67] and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colony's economy, fostering a gold rush[68] which attracted thousands of new settlers to Brazil from Portugal and all Portuguese colonies around the world.[69] This increased level of immigration in turn caused some conflicts between newcomers and old settlers.[70]

        Portuguese expeditions known as bandeiras gradually expanded Brazil's original colonial frontiers in South America to its approximately current borders.[71][72] In this era, other European powers tried to colonize parts of Brazil, in incursions that the Portuguese had to fight, notably the French in Rio during the 1560s, in Maranhão during the 1610s, and the Dutch in Bahia and Pernambuco, during the Dutch–Portuguese War, after the end of Iberian Union.[73]

        The Portuguese colonial administration in Brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of Portugal's wealthiest and largest colony: to keep under control and eradicate all forms of slave rebellion and resistance, such as the Quilombo of Palmares,[74] and to repress all movements for autonomy or independence, such as the Minas Gerais Conspiracy.[75]

        Elevation to kingdom

        The Acclamation of King João VI of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves in Rio de Janeiro, 6 February 1818
        In late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental Portugal, causing Prince Regent John, in the name of Queen Maria I, to move the royal court from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro.[76] There they established some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local stock exchanges[77] and its National Bank, additionally ending the Portuguese monopoly on Brazilian trade and opening Brazil's ports to other nations. In 1809, in retaliation for being forced into exile, the Prince Regent ordered the conquest of French Guiana.[78]

        With the end of the Peninsular War in 1814, the courts of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent John return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony. In 1815, to justify continuing to live in Brazil, where the royal court had thrived for six years, the Crown established the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state.[79] However, the leadership in Portugal, resentful of the new status of its larger colony, continued to demand the return of the court to Lisbon (see Liberal Revolution of 1820). In 1821, acceding to the demands of revolutionaries who had taken the city of Porto,[80] John VI departed for Lisbon. There he swore an oath to the new constitution, leaving his son, Prince Pedro de Alcântara, as Regent of the Kingdom of Brazil.[81]

        Independent empire
        Main articles: Independence of Brazil and Empire of Brazil

        Declaration of the Brazilian independence by Pedro I on 7 September 1822
        Tensions between Portuguese and Brazilians increased and the Portuguese Cortes, guided by the new political regime imposed by the Liberal Revolution, tried to re-establish Brazil as a colony.[82] The Brazilians refused to yield, and Prince Pedro decided to side with them, declaring the country's independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822.[83] A month later, Prince Pedro was proclaimed the first Emperor of Brazil, with the royal title of Dom Pedro I, resulting in the founding of the Empire of Brazil.[84]

        The Brazilian War of Independence, which had already begun along this process, spread through the northern, northeastern regions and in the Cisplatina province.[85] The last Portuguese soldiers surrendered on 8 March 1824;[86] Portugal officially recognized Brazilian independence on 29 August 1825.[87]

        On 7 April 1831, worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissent with both liberals and conservatives, including an attempt of republican secession[88] and unreconciled to the way that absolutists in Portugal had given in the succession of King John VI, Pedro I departed for Portugal to reclaim his daughter's crown after abdicating the Brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir (Dom Pedro II).[89]


        Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil between 1831 and 1889
        As the new Emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he came of age, a regency was set up by the General Assembly.[90] In the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power, a series of localized rebellions took place, such as the Cabanagem in Grão-Pará, the Malê Revolt in Salvador, the Balaiada (Maranhão), the Sabinada (Bahia), and the Ragamuffin War, which began in Rio Grande do Sul and was supported by Giuseppe Garibaldi. These emerged from the provinces' dissatisfaction with the central power, coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar to a vast, slaveholding and newly independent nation state.[91] This period of internal political and social upheaval, which included the Praieira revolt in Pernambuco, was overcome only at the end of the 1840s, years after the end of the regency, which occurred with the premature coronation of Pedro II in 1841.[92]

        During the last phase of the monarchy, internal political debate centered on the issue of slavery. The Atlantic slave trade was outlawed in 1850,[93] as a result of the British Aberdeen Act and the Eusébio de Queirós Law, but only in May 1888, after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in the country, was the institution formally abolished with the approval of the Golden Law.[94]

        The foreign-affairs policies of the monarchy dealt with issues pertaining Brazil's neighboring countries in the Southern Cone. Long after the Cisplatine War that resulted in the independence of Uruguay,[95] Brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of Pedro II: the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the devastating Paraguayan War, the largest war effort in Brazilian history.[96][97]

        Although there was no desire among the majority of Brazilians to change the country's form of government,[98] on 15 November 1889, in disagreement with the majority of the Imperial Army officers, as well as with rural and financial elites, the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup.[99] A few days later, the national flag was replaced with a new design that included the national motto "Ordem e Progresso", influenced by positivism. 15 November is now Republic Day, a national holiday.[100]

        Construction of the National Congress building in Brasília, 1959, during the JK administration
        The early republican government was a military dictatorship, with the army dominating affairs both in Rio de Janeiro and in the states. Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power.[101] Not until 1894, following an economic crisis and a military one, did civilians take power, remaining there until October 1930.[102][103][104]

        In this first republican period, Brazil maintained a relative balance characterized by a success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries,[105] only broken by the Acre War (1899–1902) and its involvement in World War I (1914–1918),[106][107][108] followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the League of Nations;[109] Internally, from the crisis of Encilhamento[110][111][112] and the Navy Revolts,[113] a prolonged cycle of financial, political and social instability began until the 1920s, keeping the country besieged by various rebellions, both civilian[114][115][116] and military.[117][118][119]

        Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent that in the wake of the murder of his running mate, the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas, supported by most of the military, successfully led the Revolution of 1930.[120][121] Vargas and the military were supposed to assume power temporarily, but instead closed down Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with his own supporters.[122][123]

        In the 1930s, three attempts to remove Vargas and his supporters from power failed. The first was the Constitutionalist Revolution in 1932, led by São Paulo's oligarchy. The second was a Communist uprising in November 1935, and the last one a putsch attempt by local fascists in May 1938.[124][125][126] The 1935 uprising created a security crisis in which Congress transferred more power to the executive branch. The 1937 coup d'état resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election and formalized Vargas as dictator, beginning the Estado Novo era. During this period, government brutality and censorship of the press increased.[127]

        During World War II, Brazil remained neutral until August 1942, when the country suffered retaliation by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in a strategic dispute over the South Atlantic, and, therefore, entered the war on the allied side.[128][129][130] In addition to its participation in the battle of the Atlantic, Brazil also sent an expeditionary force to fight in the Italian campaign.[131]

        With the Allied victory in 1945 and the end of the fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas' position became untenable, and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup, with democracy reinstated by the same army that had ended it 15 years earlier.[132] Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis, after having returned to power by election in 1950.[133][134]

        Several brief interim governments followed Vargas' suicide.[135] Juscelino Kubitschek became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory stance towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises.[136] The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably,[137] but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of Brasília, inaugurated in 1960.[138] Kubitschek's successor, Jânio Quadros, resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office.[139] His vice-president, João Goulart, assumed the presidency, but aroused strong political opposition[140] and was deposed in April 1964 by a coup that resulted in a military dictatorship.[141]

        The new regime was intended to be transitory,[142] but gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the Fifth Institutional Act in 1968.[143] Oppression was not limited to those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime, but also reached institutional opponents, artists, journalists and other members of civil society,[144][145] inside and outside the country through "Operation Condor".[146][147] Like other authoritarian regimes, due to an economic boom, known as the "economic miracle", the Brazilian military dictatorship reached a peak in popularity in the early 1970s.[148]

        Slowly, however, the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power had not slowed the repression, even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas.[149] The inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure made a redemocratization policy inevitable, which from the regime side was led by Generals Ernesto Geisel and Golbery do Couto e Silva.[150] With the enactment of the Amnesty Law in 1979, Brazil began a slow return to democracy, which was completed during the 1980s.[92]

        Contemporary era
        Main article: History of Brazil (1985–present)

        Ulysses Guimarães holding the Constitution of 1988
        Civilians returned to power in 1985 when José Sarney assumed the presidency. He became unpopular during his tenure through failure to control the economic crisis and hyperinflation he inherited from the military regime.[151] Sarney's unsuccessful government led to the election in 1989 of the almost-unknown Fernando Collor, who was subsequently impeached by the National Congress in 1992.[152] Collor was succeeded by his vice-president, Itamar Franco, who appointed Fernando Henrique Cardoso as Minister of Finance. In 1994, Cardoso devised a highly successful Plano Real that,[153] after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation, finally stabilized the Brazilian economy.[154][155] Cardoso won the 1994 election, and again in 1998.[156]

        The peaceful transition of power from Cardoso to his main opposition leader, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006), was seen as proof that Brazil had achieved a long-sought political stability.[157][158] However, sparked by indignation and frustrations accumulated over decades from corruption, police brutality, inefficiencies of the political establishment and public service, numerous peaceful protests erupted in Brazil in the middle of the first term of Dilma Rousseff, who had succeeded Lula after winning election in 2010 and again in 2014 by narrow margins.[159][160]

        Rousseff was impeached by the Brazilian Congress in 2016, halfway into her second term,[161][162] and replaced by her vice-president Michel Temer, who assumed full presidential powers after Rousseff's impeachment was accepted on 31 August. Large street protests for and against her took place during the impeachment process.[163] The charges against her were fueled by political and economic crises along with evidence of involvement with politicians from all the primary political parties. In 2017, the Supreme Court requested the investigation of 71 Brazilian lawmakers and nine ministers of President Michel Temer's cabinet who were allegedly linked to the Petrobras corruption scandal.[164] President Temer himself was also accused of corruption.[165]

        In the fiercely disputed 2018 elections, the controversial conservative candidate Jair Bolsonaro of the Social Liberal Party (PSL) was elected president, winning in the second round against Fernando Haddad, of the Workers Party (PT), with the support of 55.13% of the valid votes.[166] In the early 2020s, Brazil became one of the hardest hit countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, receiving the second-highest death toll worldwide after the United States.[167] In May 2021, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated that he would run for a third term in the 2022 Brazilian general election against Bolsonaro.[168] In October 2022, Lula was in first place in the first round, with 48.43% of the support from the electorate, and received 50.90% of the votes in the second round.[169][170] On 8 January 2023, a week after Lula's inauguration, a mob of Bolsonaro's supporters attacked Brazil's federal government buildings in the capital, Brasília, after several weeks of unrest.[171][172]

        Geography
        Main article: Geography of Brazil

        A topographic map of Brazil
        Brazil occupies a large area along the eastern coast of South America and includes much of the continent's interior,[173] sharing land borders with Uruguay to the south; Argentina and Paraguay to the southwest; Bolivia and Peru to the west; Colombia to the northwest; and Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and France (French overseas region of French Guiana) to the north. It shares a border with every South American country except Ecuador and Chile.[13]

        The Brazilian territory also encompasses a number of oceanic archipelagos, such as Fernando de Noronha, Rocas Atoll, Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, and the islands of Trindade and Martim Vaz.[13] Its size, relief, climate, and natural resources make Brazil geographically diverse.[173] Including its Atlantic islands, Brazil lies between latitudes 6°N and 34°S, and longitudes 28° and 74°W.[13]

        Brazil is the fifth largest country in the world, and third largest in the Americas, with a total area of 8,515,767.049 km2 (3,287,956 sq mi),[174] including 55,455 km2 (21,411 sq mi) of water. Brazil is the only country in the world that has the equator and the Tropic of Capricorn running through it.[13] It spans four time zones; from UTC−5 comprising the state of Acre and the westernmost portion of Amazonas, to UTC−4 in the western states, to UTC−3 in the eastern states (the national time) and UTC−2 in the Atlantic islands.[175]

        Climate
        Main article: Climate of Brazil

        Brazil map of Köppen climate classification zones
        The climate of Brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large area and varied topography, but most of the country is tropical.[13] According to the Köppen system, Brazil hosts six major climatic subtypes: desert, equatorial, tropical, semiarid, oceanic and subtropical. The different climatic conditions produce environments ranging from equatorial rainforests in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast, to temperate coniferous forests in the south and tropical savannas in central Brazil.[176]

        In Brazil, forest cover is around 59% of the total land area, equivalent to 496,619,600 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 588,898,000 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 485,396,000 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 11,223,600 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest, 44% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 30% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For 2015, 56% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership and 44% private ownership.[177][178]


        Serra dos Órgãos National Park, Teresópolis, Rio de Janeiro state
        Many regions have starkly different microclimates.[179][180] An equatorial climate characterizes much of northern Brazil. There is no real dry season, but there are some variations in the period of the year when most rain falls.[176] Temperatures average 25 °C (77 °F),[180] with more significant temperature variation between night and day than between seasons.[179] Over central Brazil, rainfall is more seasonal, characteristic of a savanna climate.[179] This region is as extensive as the Amazon basin but has a very different climate as it lies farther south at a higher altitude.[176] In the interior northeast, seasonal rainfall is even more extreme.[181] South of Bahia, near the coasts, and more southerly most of the state of São Paulo, the distribution of rainfall changes, with rain falling throughout the year.[176] The south enjoys subtropical conditions, with cool winters and average annual temperatures not exceeding 18 °C (64.4 °F);[180] winter frosts and snowfall are not rare in the highest areas.[176][179]

        The semiarid climatic region generally receives less than 800 millimeters (31.5 in) of rain,[181] most of which generally falls in a period of three to five months of the year[182] and occasionally less than this, creating long periods of drought.[179] Brazil's 1877–78 Grande Seca (Great Drought), the worst in Brazil's history,[183] caused approximately half a million deaths.[184] A similarly devastating drought occurred in 1915.[185] In 2024, for the first time, "a drought has covered all the way from the North to the country's Southeast". It is the strongest drought in Brazil since the beginning of measurement in the 1950s, covering almost 60% of the country's territory. The drought is linked to deforestation and climate change.[186][187][188]


        Since 1850, the Brazil has cumulatively contributed an amount of CO2 placing it among the top emitters in the world, mainly due to its land use and forestry practices.[189]
        Climate change in Brazil is causing higher temperatures and longer-lasting heatwaves, changing precipitation patterns, more intense wildfires and heightened fire risk.[190] Brazil's hydropower, agriculture and urban water supplies will be affected.[191] Brazil's rainforests, and the Amazon, are particularly at risk to climate change. At worst, large areas of the Amazon River basin could turn into savannah, with severe consequences for global climate and local livelihoods.[192] Extreme weather events like droughts and flash floods are causing annual losses of around R$13 billion (US$2.6 billion), equivalent to 0.1% of the country's 2022 GDP. Climate impacts could exacerbate poverty.[191]

        Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions per person are higher than the global average, and Brazil is among the top 10 highest emitting countries. Greenhouse gas emissions by Brazil are over 4% of the annual world total.[193] In 2024 Brazil revised its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), setting a goal to cut greenhouse emissions by 59% to 67% compared to 2005 levels by 2035.[194][195] It has an indicative target of reaching carbon neutrality by 2060 if the country receives 10 billion dollars per year.[196]

        Topography and hydrography
        See also: List of rivers of Brazil

        Satellite image of the Amazon Delta
        Brazilian topography is also diverse and includes hills, mountains, plains, highlands, and scrublands. Much of the terrain lies between 200 meters (660 ft) and 800 meters (2,600 ft) in elevation.[197] The main upland area occupies most of the southern half of the country.[197] The northwestern parts of the plateau consist of broad, rolling terrain broken by low, rounded hills.[197]

        The southeastern section is more rugged, with a complex mass of ridges and mountain ranges reaching elevations of up to 1,200 meters (3,900 ft).[197] These ranges include the Mantiqueira and Espinhaço mountains and the Serra do Mar.[197] In the north, the Guiana Highlands form a major drainage divide, separating rivers that flow south into the Amazon Basin from rivers that empty into the Orinoco River system, in Venezuela, to the north. The highest point in Brazil is the Pico da Neblina at 2,994 meters (9,823 ft), and the lowest is the Atlantic Ocean.[13]

        Brazil has a dense and complex system of rivers, one of the world's most extensive, with eight major drainage basins, all of which drain into the Atlantic.[198] Major rivers include the Amazon (the world's largest in terms of water volume), the Paraná and its major tributary the Iguaçu (which includes the Iguazu Falls), the Negro, São Francisco, Xingu, Madeira and Tapajós rivers.[198]

        Biodiversity and conservation
        Main articles: Environment of Brazil, Wildlife of Brazil, and Conservation in Brazil
        Further information: Environmental issues in Brazil and Protected areas of Brazil

        The toco toucan is an animal typical of the Brazilian savannas.
        The wildlife of Brazil comprises all naturally occurring animals, plants, and fungi in the South American country. Home to 60% of the Amazon rainforest, which accounts for approximately one-tenth of all species in the world,[199] Brazil is considered to have the greatest biodiversity of any country on the planet, containing over 70% of all animal and plant species catalogued.[200] Brazil has the most known species of plants (55,000), freshwater fish (3,000) and mammals (over 689).[201] It also ranks third on the list of countries with the most bird species (1,832) and second with the most reptile species (744).[201] The number of fungal species is unknown but is large.[202] Brazil is second only to Indonesia as the country with the most endemic species.[203]

        Brazil's large territory comprises different ecosystems, such as the Amazon rainforest, recognized as having the greatest biological diversity in the world,[204] with the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado sustaining the greatest biodiversity.[205] In the south, the Araucaria moist forests grow under temperate conditions.[205] The rich wildlife of Brazil reflects the variety of natural habitats. Scientists estimate that the total number of plant and animal species in Brazil could approach four million, mostly invertebrates.[205] Larger mammals include carnivores pumas, jaguars, ocelots, rare bush dogs, and foxes, and herbivores peccaries, tapirs, anteaters, sloths, opossums and armadillos. Deer are plentiful in the south, and many species of New World monkeys are found in the northern rainforests.[205][206]


        Cumulatively, Brazil has the highest percentage of deforested and highly degraded rainforest of any Amazonia nation.[207]
        More than one-fifth of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has been completely destroyed, and more than 70 mammals are endangered.[201] The threat of extinction comes from several sources, including deforestation and poaching. Extinction is even more problematic in the Atlantic Forest, where nearly 93% of the forest has been cleared.[208] Of the 202 endangered animals in Brazil, 171 are in the Atlantic Forest.[209] The Amazon rainforest has been under direct threat of deforestation since the 1970s because of rapid economic and demographic expansion. Extensive legal and illegal logging destroy forests the size of a small country per year, and with it a diverse series of species through habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation.[210] Since 1970, over 600,000 square kilometers (230,000 sq mi) of the Amazon rainforest have been cleared by logging.[211]

        In 2017, preserved native vegetation occupied 61% of the Brazilian territory. Agriculture occupied only 8% of the national territory and pastures 19.7%.[212] For comparison, in 2019, although 43% of the entire European continent has forests, only 3% of the total forest area in Europe is of native forest.[213] Brazil has a strong interest in conservation, as its agriculture sector directly depends on its forests.[214]

        Palácio do Planalto, the official workplace of the President of Brazil
        The form of government is a democratic federative republic, with a presidential system.[15] The president is both head of state and head of government of the Union and is elected for a four-year term,[15] with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term. The current president is Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.[215] The president appoints the Ministers of State, who form the cabinet and assist in government.[15]

        Legislative houses in each political entity are the main source of law in Brazil. The National Congress is the federation's bicameral legislature, consisting of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate. The Senate represents the 26 states and the Federal District. Each state and the Federal District has a representation of three senators, who are elected by popular ballot for a term of eight years.[216][217] The Chamber of Deputies represents the people of each state, and its members are elected for a four-year term by a system of proportional representation.[218] Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively.

        According to International IDEA’s Global State of Democracy (GSoD) Indices and Democracy Tracker, Brazil performs in the mid to high range on overall democratic measures, with particular strengths in inclusive suffrage, freedom of religion, and civic engagement.[219] In 2021, the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index categorized Brazil as a "flawed democracy", ranking 46th in the report,[220] and Freedom House classified it as a free country at Freedom in the World report.[221] According to the Regimes of the World classification Brazil was an electoral democracy in year 2024.[222]

        The political-administrative organization of the Federative Republic of Brazil comprises the Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities.[15] The Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities, are the "spheres of government". The federation is set on five fundamental principles: sovereignty, citizenship, dignity of human beings, the social values of labor and freedom of enterprise, and political pluralism.[15]

        The classic tripartite branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial under a checks and balances system) are formally established by the Constitution.[15] The executive and legislative are organized independently in all three spheres of government, while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state and Federal District spheres. All members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected.[223][224][225]

        For most of its democratic history, Brazil has had a multi-party system, with proportional representation. Voting is compulsory for the literate between 18 and 70 years old and optional for illiterates and those between 16 and 18 or beyond 70.[15] The country has around 30 registered political parties. Twenty political parties are represented in Congress. It is common for politicians to switch parties, and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly.[226]

        Law
        Main article: Law of Brazil

        The Supreme Federal Court of Brazil serves primarily as the Constitutional Court of the country
        Brazilian law is based on the civil law legal system[227] and civil law concepts prevail over common law practice. Most of Brazilian law is codified, although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines; however, they are seldom binding on other specific cases. Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases. Judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams.[223]

        The legal system is based on the Federal Constitution, promulgated on 5 October 1988, and the fundamental law of Brazil. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules.[228] As of July 2022, there have been 124 amendments.[229] The highest court is the Supreme Federal Court. States have their own constitutions, which must not contradict the Federal Constitution.[230] Municipalities and the Federal District have "organic laws" (leis orgânicas), which act in a similar way to constitutions.[231] Legislative entities are the main source of statutes, although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms.[15] Jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare situations the Federal Constitution allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments.[15] There are also specialized military, labor and electoral courts.[15]

        Political subdivisions
        Main article: Subdivisions of Brazil
        Further information: Municipalities of Brazil, States of Brazil, and Regions of Brazil
        Brazil is a federation composed of 26 states, one federal district, and the 5,571 municipalities.[15] States have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Federal government. They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters. They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice. Despite this, states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in other federal states such as the United States. Criminal and civil laws can be voted by only the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country.[15]

        Municipalities, as the states, have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the federal and state government.[15] Each has an elected mayor and legislative body, but no separate Court of Law. Indeed, a Court of Law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called comarca.[15]

        Brazil's constitution also provides for the creation of federal territories, which are administrative divisions directly controlled by the federal government. However, there are currently no federal territories in the country, as the 1988 Constitution abolished the last three: Amapá and Roraima (which gained statehood) and Fernando de Noronha, which became a state district of Pernambuco.[232][233]

        Foreign relations
        Main article: Foreign relations of Brazil

        Itamaraty Palace, the seat of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
        Brazil's international relations are based on Article 4 of the Federal Constitution, which establishes non-intervention, self-determination, international cooperation and the peaceful settlement of conflicts as the guiding principles of Brazil's relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations.[234] According to the Constitution, the President has ultimate authority over foreign policy, while Congress is tasked with reviewing and considering all diplomatic nominations and international treaties, as well as legislation relating to Brazilian foreign policy.[235]

        Brazil's foreign policy is a by-product of the country's position as a regional power in Latin America, a leader among developing countries, and an emerging world power.[236] Brazilian foreign policy has generally been based on the principles of multilateralism, peaceful dispute settlement, and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries.[237] Brazil is a founding member state of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth, an international organization and political association of Lusophone nations.

        An increasingly well-developed tool of Brazil's foreign policy is providing aid as a donor to other developing countries.[238] Brazil does not just use its growing economic strength to provide financial aid, but it also provides high levels of expertise and most importantly of all, a quiet non-confrontational diplomacy to improve governance levels.[238] Total aid is estimated to be around $1 billion per year.[238] In addition, Brazil already managed a peacekeeping mission in Haiti ($350 million) and makes in-kind contributions to the World Food Programme ($300 million).[238] The scale of this aid places it on par with China and India.[238] The Brazilian South-South aid has been described as a "global model in waiting".[239]

        The armed forces of Brazil are the largest in Latin America by active personnel and the largest in terms of military equipment.[240] It consists of the Brazilian Army (including the Army Aviation Command), the Brazilian Navy (including the Marine Corps and Naval Aviation) and the Brazilian Air Force. Brazil's conscription policy gives it one of the world's largest military forces, estimated at more than 1.6 million reservists annually.[241] The Air Force is the largest in Latin America and has about 700 crewed aircraft in service and effective about 67,000 personnel.[242]

        Numbering close to 236,000 active personnel,[243] the Brazilian Army has the largest number of armored vehicles in South America, including armored transports and tanks.[244] The states' Military Police and the Military Firefighters Corps are designated as auxiliary forces of the Army by the constitution, but are under the control of each state's governor.[15]

        Brazil's navy once operated some of the most powerful warships in the world with the two Minas Geraes-class dreadnoughts, sparking a naval arms race between Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.[245] Today, it is a green water force and has a group of specialized elite in retaking ships and naval facilities, GRUMEC, unit specially trained to protect Brazilian oil platforms along its coast.[246] As of 2022, it is the only navy in Latin America that operates a helicopter carrier, NAM Atlântico and one of twelve navies in the world to operate or have one under construction.[247]

        Law enforcement and crime
        Main articles: Law enforcement in Brazil and Crime in Brazil

        Headquarters of the Federal Police of Brazil in Brasília
        In Brazil, the Constitution establishes six different police agencies for law enforcement: Federal Police Department, Federal Highway Police, Federal Railroad Police, Federal, District and State Penal Police (included by the Constitutional Amendment No. 104, of 2019), Military Police and Civil Police. Of these, the first three are affiliated with federal authorities, the last two are subordinate to state governments and the Penal Police can be subordinated to the federal or state/district government. All police forces are overseen by the executive branch of the federal or state government.[15] The National Public Security Force also can act in public disorder situations arising anywhere in the country.[248]

        The country has high levels of violent crime, such as gun violence and homicides. In 2022, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated an intentional homicide rate of 21.1 per 100,000 inhabitants.[249] The number considered acceptable by the World Health Organization (WHO) is about 10 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.[250] In 2024, Brazil recorded 38,772 homicides, down from 40,768 in 2023,[251] and from a record 63,880 in 2017.[252] Homicide rates vary regionally. While in São Paulo the homicide rate registered in 2023 was 6.4 per 100,000 inhabitants, in Amapá it was 57.4 per 100,000 inhabitants.[253] The national homicide rate for 2024 was 17.9 per 100,000 inhabitants, the lowest in over a decade.[251]

        Brazil also has high levels of incarceration. It had the third largest prison population in the world of approximately 909,067 prisoners in 2024, which put it only behind the United States (1,808,100) and China (1,690,000).[254] The high number of prisoners eventually overloaded the Brazilian prison system, leading to a shortfall of about 200,000 accommodations.[255]

        Human rights
        See also: Human rights in Brazil
        Human rights in Brazil include the right to life and freedom of speech; and condemnation of slavery and torture. The nation ratified the American Convention on Human Rights.[256] The 2017 Freedom in the World report by Freedom House gives Brazil a score of "2" for both political rights and civil liberties; "1" represents the most free, and "7", the least.[257] According to UNESCO, "Brazil promotes a vast array of actions for the advancement and defense of human rights, even though it faces enormous social and economic inequalities".[258] Same-sex couples in Brazil have held nationwide marriage rights since May 2013.[259]

        Brazil is a developing country with an upper-middle income mixed market economy that is rich in natural resources.[263] It has the largest national economy in Latin America, the tenth largest economy in the world by nominal GDP, and the eighth largest by PPP.[264] After rapid growth in preceding decades, Brazil entered a recession in 2014 amid a political corruption scandal and nationwide protests; in 2024, the economy began showing consistent significant growth.[265] Brazil has a labor force of roughly 100 million, which is the world's fifth largest.[266] Its foreign exchange reserves are the tenth-highest in the world.[267] The B3 in São Paulo is the largest stock exchange of Latin America by market capitalization. Roughly one-fifth of Brazilians live in poverty: about 3.8% of the total population lives at $3.00 a day,[268] while about 23% live at $8.30 a day.[269] Brazil's economy suffers from endemic corruption and high income inequality.[270] The Brazilian real is the national currency.

        Brazil's diversified economy includes agriculture, industry and a wide range of services.[271] The large service sector accounts for about 72.7% of total GDP, followed by the industrial sector (20.7%), while the agriculture sector is by far the smallest, making up 6.6% of total GDP.[272]

        Brazil is one of the largest producers of various agricultural commodities,[273] and also has a large cooperative sector that provides 50% of the food in the country.[274] It has been the world's largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years[27] and is the world's largest producer of sugarcane, soy, coffee and oranges; is one of the top five producers of maize, cotton, lemon, tobacco, pineapple, banana, beans, coconut, watermelon and papaya; and is one of the top 10 world producers of cocoa, cashew, mango, rice, tomato, sorghum, tangerine, avocado, persimmon, and guava, among others. Regarding livestock, it is one of the five largest producers of chicken meat, beef, pork and cow's milk in the world.[275]

        In the mining sector, Brazil is among the largest producers of iron ore, copper, gold,[276] bauxite, manganese, tin, niobium,[277] and nickel. In terms of precious stones, Brazil is the world's largest producer of amethyst, topaz, agate and one of the main producers of tourmaline, emerald, aquamarine, garnet and opal.[278][279] The country is a major exporter of soy, iron ore, pulp (cellulose), maize, beef, chicken meat, soybean meal, sugar, coffee, tobacco, cotton, orange juice, footwear, airplanes, cars, vehicle parts, gold, ethanol and semi-finished iron, among other products.[280][281]

        Brazil is the world's 24th-largest exporter and 26th-largest importer as of 2021.[282][283] China is its largest trading partner, accounting for 32% of the total trade. Other large trading partners include the United States, Argentina, the Netherlands and Canada.[284] Its automotive industry is the eighth-largest in the world.[285] In the food industry, Brazil was the second-largest exporter of processed foods in the world in 2019.[286] The country was the second-largest producer of pulp in the world and the eighth-largest producer of paper in 2016.[287] In the footwear industry, Brazil was the fourth-largest producer in 2019.[288] It was also the ninth-largest producer of steel in the world.[289][290][291] In 2018, the chemical industry of Brazil was the eighth-largest in the world.[292][293][294] Although it was among the five largest world producers in 2013, Brazil's textile industry is very little integrated into world trade.[295]

        The tertiary sector (trade and services) represented 75.8% of the country's GDP in 2018, according to the IBGE. The service sector was responsible for 60% of GDP and trade for 13%. It covers commerce, transport, education, social and health services, research and development, sports activities, etc.[296][297] Micro and small businesses represent 30% of the country's GDP. In the commercial sector they represent 53% of the GDP within the activities of the sector.[298]

        Tourism in Brazil is a growing sector and key to the economies of several regions of the country. The country had 6.36 million visitors in 2015, ranking in terms of the international tourist arrivals as the main destination in South America and second in Latin America after Mexico.[299] Revenues from international tourists reached US$6 billion in 2010, showing a recovery from the 2008–2009 economic crisis.[300] Historical records of 5.4 million visitors and US$6.8 billion in receipts were reached in 2011.[301][302] In the list of world tourist destinations, in 2018, Brazil was the 48th most visited country, with 6.6 million tourists (and revenues of 5.9 billion dollars).[303]

        Natural areas are its most popular tourism product, a combination of ecotourism with leisure and recreation, mainly sun and beach, and adventure travel, as well as cultural tourism. Among the most popular destinations are the Amazon Rainforest, beaches and dunes in the Northeast Region, the Pantanal in the Center-West Region, beaches at Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina, cultural tourism in Minas Gerais and business trips to São Paulo.[304]

        In terms of the 2024 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI), which is a measurement of the factors that make it attractive to develop business in the travel and tourism industry of individual countries, Brazil ranked in the 26th place at the world's level, third in the Americas, after Canada and United States.[305] Domestic tourism is a key market segment for the tourism industry in Brazil. In 2005, 51 million Brazilian nationals made ten times more trips than foreign tourists and spent five times more money than their international counterparts.[306] The main destination states in 2023 were São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Rio Grande do Sul.[307][308] The main source of tourists for the entire country is São Paulo state.[309] In terms of tourism revenues, the top earners by state were São Paulo and Bahia.[310] For 2005, the three main trip purposes were visiting friends and family (53.1%), sun and beach (40.8%), and cultural tourism (12.5%).[311]

        Technological research in Brazil is largely carried out in public universities and research institutes, with the majority of funding for basic research coming from various government agencies.[312] Brazil's most esteemed technological hubs are the Oswaldo Cruz Institute, the Butantan Institute, the Air Force's Aerospace Technical Center, the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation and the National Institute for Space Research.[313][314]

        The Brazilian Space Agency has the most advanced space program in Latin America, with significant resources to launch vehicles, and manufacture of satellites.[315] The country develops submarines and aircraft, as well as being involved in space research, having a Vehicle Launch Center Light and being the only country in the Southern Hemisphere to integrate a team building the well-known International Space Station (ISS).[316]

        The country is also a pioneer in the search for oil in deep water, from where it extracts 73% of its reserves. Uranium is enriched at the Resende Nuclear Fuel Factory, mostly for research purposes (as Brazil obtains 88% of its electricity from hydroelectricity)[317] and the country's first nuclear submarine is expected to be launched in 2029.[318]

        Brazil is one of the three countries in Latin America[319] with an operational Synchrotron Laboratory, a research facility on physics, chemistry, material science and life sciences, and Brazil is the only Latin American country to have a semiconductor company with its own fabrication plant, the CEITEC.[320] According to the Global Information Technology Report 2009–2010 of the World Economic Forum, Brazil is the world's 61st largest developer of information technology.[321] Brazil was ranked 50th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, up from 66th in 2019.[322][323][324]

        Among the most renowned Brazilian inventors are priests Bartolomeu de Gusmão, Landell de Moura and Francisco João de Azevedo, besides Alberto Santos-Dumont,[325] Evaristo Conrado Engelberg,[326] Manuel Dias de Abreu,[327] Andreas Pavel[328] and Nélio José Nicolai.[329] Brazilian science is represented by the likes of César Lattes (Brazilian physicist Pathfinder of Pi Meson),[330] Mário Schenberg (considered the greatest theoretical physicist of Brazil),[331] José Leite Lopes (the only Brazilian physicist holder of the UNESCO Science Prize),[332] Artur Avila (the first Latin American winner of the Fields Medal)[333] and Fritz Müller (pioneer in factual support of the theory of evolution by Charles Darwin).[334]

        Energy

        Wind farm in Parnaíba, Piauí. Brazil is one of the 5 largest producers of wind energy in the world
        Brazil is the world's eleventh-largest energy consumer.[335] Much of its energy comes from renewable sources, particularly hydroelectricity and ethanol; the Itaipu Dam is the world's largest hydroelectric plant by energy generation,[336] and the country has other large plants such as Belo Monte and Tucuruí. The first car with an ethanol engine was produced in 1978 and the first airplane engine running on ethanol in 2005.[337]

        At the end of 2021 Brazil was the 2nd country in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (109.4 GW) and biomass (15.8 GW), the 7th country in the world in terms of installed wind power (21.1 GW) and the 14th country in the world in terms of installed solar power (13.0 GW)—on track to also become one of the top 10 in the world in solar energy.[338] At the end of 2024, Brazil was the 4th largest producer of wind energy in the world (107.8 TWh), behind only China, the United States and Germany, and the 5th largest producer of solar energy in the world (74.7 TWh).[339]

        The main characteristic of the Brazilian energy matrix is that it is much more renewable than that of the world. While in 2019, the world matrix was only 14% made up of renewable energy, Brazil's was at 45%. Petroleum and oil products made up 34.3% of the matrix; sugar cane derivatives, 18%; hydraulic energy, 12.4%; natural gas, 12.2%; firewood and charcoal, 8.8%; varied renewable energies, 7%; mineral coal, 5.3%; nuclear, 1.4%, and other non-renewable energies, 0.6%.[340]

        In the electric energy matrix, the difference between Brazil and the world is even greater: while the world only had 25% of renewable electric energy in 2019, Brazil had 83%. The Brazilian electric matrix was composed of: hydraulic energy, 64.9%; biomass, 8.4%; wind energy, 8.6%; solar energy, 1%; natural gas, 9.3%; oil products, 2%; nuclear, 2.5%; coal and derivatives, 3.3%.[340] Brazil has the largest electricity sector in Latin America. Its capacity at the end of 2021 was 181,532 MW.[341]

        The Brazilian government has embarked on a program over the decades to reduce dependence on imported oil, which previously accounted for more than 70% of the country's oil needs. Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in 2006–2007. In 2021, the country closed the year as the 7th oil producer in the world, with an average of close to three million barrels per day, becoming an exporter of the product.[342][343]

        Brazilian roads are the primary carriers of freight and passenger traffic. The road system totaled 1,720,000 km (1,068,758 mi) in 2019.[346] The total of paved roads increased from 35,496 km (22,056 mi) in 1967 to 215,000 km (133,595 mi) in 2018.[347]

        Brazil's railway system has been declining since 1945, when emphasis shifted to highway construction. The country's total railway track length was 30,576 km (18,999 mi) in 2015,[348] as compared with 31,848 km (19,789 mi) in 1970, making it the ninth largest network in the world. Most of the railway system belonged to the Federal Railroad Network Corporation (RFFSA), which was privatized in 2007.[349] The São Paulo Metro began operating on 14 September 1974 as the first underground transit system in Brazil.[350]

        There are about 2,500 airports in Brazil, including landing fields: the second-largest number in the world, after the United States.[351] São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport, near São Paulo, is the largest and busiest airport with nearly 43 million passengers annually, while handling the vast majority of commercial traffic for the country.[352][353]

        For freight transport, waterways are of importance. The industrial zones of Manaus can be reached only by means of the Solimões–Amazonas waterway (3,250 kilometers or 2,020 miles in length, with a minimum depth of six meters or 20 feet). The country also has 50,000 kilometers (31,000 miles) of waterways.[354] Coastal shipping links widely separated parts of the country. Bolivia and Paraguay have been given free ports at Santos. Of the 36 deep-water ports, Santos, Itajaí, Rio Grande, Paranaguá, Rio de Janeiro, Sepetiba, Vitória, Suape, Manaus and São Francisco do Sul are the most important.[355] Bulk carriers have to wait up to 18 days before being serviced; container ships take 36.3 hours on average.[356]

        Demographics
        Main articles: Demographics of Brazil and Brazilians
        See also: Immigration to Brazil and List of Brazilian states by population density

        Population density of Brazilian municipalities
        According to the latest official projection, Brazil's estimated population was 213,421,037 on 1 July 2025—an increase from the figure of 203 million reported by the 2022 census.[357][358] The population of Brazil, as recorded by the 2008 PNAD, was approximately 190 million[359] (22.31 inhabitants per square kilometer or 57.8/sq mi), with a ratio of men to women of 0.95:1[360] and 83.75% of the population defined as urban.[361] The population is heavily concentrated in the Southeast (89 million inhabitants) and Northeast (54.6 million inhabitants), while the two most extensive regions, the Center-West and the North, which together make up 64.12% of Brazilian territory, have a total of only 33.8 million inhabitants.

        The first census in Brazil was carried out in 1872 and recorded a population of 9,930,478.[362] From 1880 to 1930, four million Europeans arrived.[363] Brazil's population increased significantly between 1940 and 1970, because of a decline in the mortality rate, even though the birth rate underwent a slight decline. In the 1940s the annual population growth rate was 2.4%, rising to 3.0% in the 1950s and remaining at 2.9% in the 1960s, as life expectancy rose from 44 to 54 years[364] and to 72.6 years in 2007.[365] It has been steadily falling since the 1960s, from 3.04% per year between 1950 and 1960 to 1.05% in 2008 and is expected to fall to a negative value of –0.29% by 2050[366] thus completing the demographic transition.[367] In 2022, the illiteracy rate was roughly 7%,[368] a significant decline from 11.48% in 2008.[369] By comparison, in 1940, more than half the population (54%) was illiterate.[368]

        Urbanization
        Main article: List of cities in Brazil by population
        According to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) urban areas already concentrate 84.35% of the population, while the Southeast region remains the most populated one, with over 80 million inhabitants.[370] The largest urban agglomerations in Brazil are São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte—all in the Southeastern Region—with 21.1, 12.3, and 5.1 million inhabitants respectively.[371][372][373] The majority of state capitals are the largest cities in their states, except for Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, and Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina.[374]

        Blacks (10.2%)
        Indigenous (0.60%)
        East Asians (0.42%)
        According to the 2022 Brazilian census, 45.3% of the population (92.1 million) described themselves as Pardo (meaning brown or multiracial), 43.5% (88.2 million) as White, 10.2% (20.7 million) as Black, 0.6% (1.2 million) as Indigenous and 0.4% (850,000) as East Asian (officially called yellow or amarela).[377]

        Since the arrival of the Portuguese in 1500, considerable genetic mixing between Amerindians, Europeans, and Africans has taken place in all regions of the country:

        European ancestry being dominant according to all autosomal studies undertaken covering the population, accounting for between 60% and 65% of the average genetic makeup of the Brazilian population.[378][379][380][381]
        African ancestry among the Brazilians is estimated at 20% to 25% of the average genetic makeup[380][382][383]
        Indigenous ancestry is significant and present in all regions of Brazil, accounting for around 15% to 20% of the average genetic ancestry of Brazilians.[382][384][385][386][387][388][389]
        From the 19th century, Brazil opened its borders to immigration. About five million people from over 60 countries migrated to Brazil between 1808 and 1972, most of them of Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, German, English, Ukrainian, Polish, Jewish, African, Armenian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Arab origin.[390][391][392] Brazil has the second-largest Jewish community in both Latin America after Argentina making up 0.06% of its population.[393] Outside of the Arab world, Brazil also has the largest population of Arab ancestry in the world, with 15–20 million people.[394][395] According to Brazil's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Brazil is home to a Lebanese diaspora of 7 million to 10 million, surpassing the population of Lebanese individuals residing in Lebanon.[396]

        Brazilian society is more markedly divided by social class lines, although a high income disparity is found between race groups, so racism and classism often overlap. The brown population (officially called pardo in Portuguese)[397][398] is a broad category that includes caboclos (assimilated Amerindians in general, and descendants of Whites and Natives), mulatos (descendants of primarily Whites and Afro-Brazilians) and cafuzos (descendants of Afro-Brazilians and Natives).[397][398][399][400][401] Higher percents of Blacks, mulattoes and tri-racials can be found in the eastern coast of the Northeastern region from Bahia to Paraíba[401][402] and also in northern Maranhão,[403][404] southern Minas Gerais[405] and eastern Rio de Janeiro.[401][405]

        People of considerable Amerindian ancestry form the majority of the population in the Northern, Northeastern and Center-Western regions.[406] In 2007, the National Indian Foundation estimated that Brazil has 67 different uncontacted tribes, up from their estimate of 40 in 2005. Brazil is believed to have the largest number of uncontacted peoples in the world.[407]

        Pomerode, Santa Catarina, where the East Pomeranian is the second language (see Brazilian German)
        The official language of Brazil is Portuguese (Article 13 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Brazil), which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers, radio, television, and for business and administrative purposes. Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity and giving it a national culture distinct from those of its Spanish-speaking neighbors.[408]

        Brazilian Portuguese has had its own development, mostly similar to 16th-century Central and Southern dialects of European Portuguese[409] (despite a very substantial number of Portuguese colonial settlers, and more recent immigrants, coming from Northern regions, and in minor degree Portuguese Macaronesia), with a few influences from the Amerindian and African languages, especially West African and Bantu restricted to the vocabulary only.[410] As a result, the language is somewhat different, mostly in phonology, from the language of Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking countries (the dialects of the other countries, partly because of the more recent end of Portuguese colonialism in these regions, have a closer connection to contemporary European Portuguese). These differences are comparable to those between American and British English.[410]

        The 2002 sign language law[411] requires government authorities and public agencies to accept and provide information in Língua Brasileira dos Sinais or "LIBRAS", the Brazilian Sign Language, while a 2005 presidential edict[412] extends this to require teaching of the language as a part of the education and speech and language pathology curricula. LIBRAS teachers, instructors and translators are recognized professionals. Schools and health services must provide access ("inclusion") to deaf people.[413]

        Minority languages are spoken throughout the nation. One hundred and eighty Amerindian languages are spoken in remote areas and a significant number of other languages are spoken by immigrants and their descendants.[410] In the municipality of São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Nheengatu (a currently endangered creole language that, together with its southern relative língua geral paulista, once was a major lingua franca in Brazil),[414] Baniwa and Tucano languages had been granted co-official status with Portuguese.[415]

        There are significant communities of German (mostly the Brazilian Hunsrückisch, a High German language dialect) and Italian (mostly the Talian, a Venetian dialect) origins in the Southern and Southeastern regions, whose ancestors' native languages were carried along to Brazil, and which, still alive there, are influenced by the Portuguese language.[416][417] Talian is officially a historic heritage of Rio Grande do Sul,[418] and two German dialects possess co-official status in a few municipalities.[419] Italian is also recognized as "ethnic language" in Santa Teresa and Vila Velha, in the state of Espírito Santo.[420]

        Religion
        Main article: Religion in Brazil
        Further information: Catholic Church in Brazil and Protestantism in Brazil
        Religion in Brazil (2022 Census)
        Catholicism (56.8%)
        Protestantism (26.9%)
        No religion (9.28%)
        Spiritism (1.84%)
        Other religions (5.06%)
        Not stated (0.17%)
        Christianity is the country's predominant faith, with Catholicism being its largest denomination. Brazil has the world's largest Catholic population.[421][422][423] According to the 2022 demographic census (the PNAD survey does not inquire about religion), 56.75% of the population followed Catholicism; 26.85% Protestantism; 1.84% Kardecist spiritism; 5.06% other religions, undeclared or undetermined; while 9.28% had no religion.[3]

        Religious diversity in Brazil developed from the meeting of the Catholic Church with the religious traditions of enslaved African peoples and indigenous peoples.[424] This confluence of faiths during the Portuguese colonization of Brazil led to the development of a diverse array of syncretistic practices within the overarching umbrella of Brazilian Catholic Church, characterized by traditional Portuguese festivities.[425]

        Religious pluralism increased during the 20th century,[426] and the Protestant community had grown to include over 22% of the population by 2010—partly due to a mixture of American missionary and government influence.[427][428] The most common Protestant denominations are Evangelical Pentecostal ones. Other Protestant branches with a notable presence in the country include the Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, Lutherans and the Reformed tradition.[429] In recent decades, Protestantism, particularly in forms of Pentecostalism and Evangelicalism, has spread in Brazil, while the proportion of Catholics had dropped significantly during the 2010s.[430] As they have spread throughout Brazil, many have even been deeply involved in Brazilian and international politics,[431][432] and Evangelical Protestant influence has been implicated in the 2022 Brazilian coup plot.[433] Since 2022, Evangelicals and Catholics have begun reconsidering religion as a political factor.[434]

        After Protestantism, individuals professing no religion are also a significant group, having exceeded 8% of the population according to the 2010 census. The cities of Boa Vista, Salvador, and Porto Velho have the greatest proportion of Irreligious residents in Brazil. Teresina, Fortaleza, and Florianópolis were the most Roman Catholic in the country.[435] Greater Rio de Janeiro, not including the city proper, is the most irreligious and least Roman Catholic Brazilian periphery, while Greater Porto Alegre and Greater Fortaleza are on the opposite sides of the lists, respectively.[435]

        In October 2009, the Brazilian Senate approved and enacted by the President of Brazil in February 2010, an agreement with the Vatican, in which the Legal Statute of the Catholic Church in Brazil is recognized.[436][437]

        Historical building of the Federal University of Paraná, one of the oldest universities in Brazil, located in Curitiba
        The Federal Constitution and the Law of Guidelines and Bases of National Education determine that the Union, the states, the Federal District and the municipalities must manage and organize their respective education systems. Each of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance, which manages funds as well as the mechanisms and funding sources. The constitution reserves 25% of the state budget and 18% of federal taxes and municipal taxes for education.[438]

        According to the IBGE, the literacy rate was 93.4% in 2019, meaning that 11.3 million (6.6% of population) people are still illiterate in the country, with some states such as Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina reaching around 97% of literacy rate;[439] functional illiteracy has reached 21.6% of the population.[440] Illiteracy is higher in the Northeast, where 13.87% of the population is illiterate, while the South, has 3.3% of its population illiterate.[441][439]

        Brazil's private institutions tend to be more exclusive and offer better quality education, so many high-income families send their children there. The result is a segregated educational system that reflects extreme income disparities and reinforces social inequality. However, efforts to change this are making impacts.[442] The University of São Paulo is often considered the best in Brazil and Latin America.[443][444] Of the top 20 Latin American universities, eight are Brazilian; most are public. Attending an institution of higher education is required by Law of Guidelines and Bases of Education. Kindergarten, elementary and medium education are required of all students.[445]

        Health

        The Clinical Hospital of Porto Alegre is academically linked to the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul and is part of the SUS, the Brazilian publicly funded health care system
        The Brazilian public health system, the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde – SUS), is managed and provided by all levels of government,[446] being the largest system of this type in the world.[447] On the other hand, private healthcare systems play a complementary role.[448] Public health services are universal and offered to all citizens of the country for free. However, the construction and maintenance of health centers and hospitals are financed by taxes, and the country spends about 9% of its GDP on expenditures in the area. In 2021, Brazil had 2.1 doctors and 2.5 hospital beds for every 1,000 inhabitants.[449][450]

        Despite all the progress made since the creation of the universal health care system in 1988, there are still several public health issues in Brazil. In 2023, infant (2.51%) and maternal mortality rates (197.3 deaths per 100,000 births) were still high.[451]

        The number of deaths from noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (151.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) and cancer (72.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants), also has a considerable impact on the health of the Brazilian population. Finally, external but preventable factors such as car accidents, violence and suicide caused 14.9% of all deaths in the country.[451] The Brazilian health system was ranked 125th among the 191 countries evaluated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2000.[452]

        Culture
        Main article: Culture of Brazil

        The core culture of Brazil is derived from Portuguese culture, due to its strong colonial ties with the Portuguese Empire.[454] Among other influences, the Portuguese introduced the Portuguese language, Roman Catholicism and colonial architectural styles. Brazilian culture was also strongly influenced by African, indigenous and non-Portuguese European cultures and traditions.[455]

        Some aspects of Brazilian culture were influenced by the contributions of Italian, German and other European as well as Japanese, Jewish and Arab immigrants who arrived in large numbers in the South and Southeast of Brazil during the 19th and 20th centuries.[456] The indigenous Amerindians influenced Brazil's language and cuisine; and the Africans influenced language, cuisine, music, dance and religion.[457]

        Brazilian art has developed since the 16th century into different styles that range from Baroque (the dominant style in Brazil until the early 19th century)[458][459] to Romanticism, Modernism, Expressionism, Cubism, Surrealism and Abstractionism. Brazilian cinema dates back to the birth of the medium in the late 19th century and has gained a new level of international acclaim since the 1960s.[460]

        Architecture
        Main article: Architecture of Brazil

        The Cathedral of Brasília, designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer for the federal capital, an example of Modern architecture
        The architecture of Brazil is influenced by Europe, especially Portugal. It has a history that goes back 500 years to the time, when Pedro Álvares Cabral landed in Brazil in 1500. Portuguese colonial architecture was the first wave of architecture to go to Brazil.[461] It is the basis for all Brazilian architecture of later centuries.[462] In the 19th century, during the time of the Empire of Brazil, the country followed European trends and adopted Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architecture. Then, in the 20th century, especially in Brasília, Brazil experimented with modernist architecture.

        The colonial architecture of Brazil dates to the early 16th century, when Brazil was first explored, conquered and settled by the Portuguese. The Portuguese built architecture familiar to them in Europe in their aim to colonize Brazil. They built Portuguese colonial architecture, which included churches and civic architecture, including houses and forts, in Brazilian cities and the countryside.[463]

        During the 19th century, Brazilian architecture saw the introduction of more European styles to Brazil, such as Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architecture. This was usually mixed with Brazilian influences from their own heritage.[463] In the 1950s modernist architecture was introduced when Brasília was built as a new federal capital in the interior of Brazil to help develop the interior. The architect Oscar Niemeyer idealized and built government buildings, churches and civic buildings in the modernist style.[464]

        Visual arts
        Main article: Brazilian painting

        Brazilian painting emerged in the late 16th century,[465] influenced by Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Realism, Modernism, Expressionism, Surrealism, Cubism and Abstracionism making it a major art style called Brazilian academic art.[466][467]

        The French Artistic Mission arrived in Brazil in 1816 proposing the creation of an art academy modeled after the respected Académie des Beaux-Arts, with graduation courses both for artists and craftsmen for activities such as modeling, decorating, carpentry and others and bringing artists such as Jean-Baptiste Debret.[467]

        Upon the creation of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, new artistic movements spread across the country during the 19th century and later the event called Modern Art Week broke with academic tradition in 1922 and started a nationalist trend which was influenced by modernist arts.[468]

        Among the best-known Brazilian painters are Ricardo do Pilar and Manoel da Costa Ataíde (baroque and rococo), Victor Meirelles, Pedro Américo and Almeida Júnior (romanticism and realism), Anita Malfatti, Ismael Nery, Lasar Segall, Emiliano Di Cavalcanti, Vicente do Rego Monteiro, and Tarsila do Amaral (expressionism, surrealism and cubism), Aldo Bonadei, José Pancetti and Candido Portinari (modernism).[469]

        Music
        Main article: Music of Brazil

        The music of Brazil was formed mainly from the fusion of European, Native Indigenous, and African elements.[470] Until the nineteenth century, Portugal was the gateway to most of the influences that built Brazilian music, although many of these elements were not of Portuguese origin, but generally European. The first was José Maurício Nunes Garcia, author of sacred pieces with an influence of Viennese classicism.[471] The major contribution of the African element was the rhythmic diversity and some dances and instruments.[470]

        Popular music since the late eighteenth century, samba was considered the most typical and on the UNESCO cultural heritage list.[472] Samba-reggae, Axé, Maracatu, Frevo and Afoxê are four music traditions that have been popularized by their appearance in the annual Brazilian Carnivals.[473] Capoeira is usually played with its own music referred to as capoeira music, which is usually considered to be a call-and-response type of folk music.[474] Forró is a type of folk music prominent during the Festa Junina in northeastern Brazil.[475] Jack A. Draper III, a professor of Portuguese at the University of Missouri,[476] argues that Forró was used as a way to subdue feelings of nostalgia for a rural lifestyle.[477]

        Choro is a popular musical instrumental style. Its origins are in 19th-century Rio de Janeiro. The style often has a fast and happy rhythm, characterized by subtle modulations and full of syncopation and counterpoint.[478] lambada and Carimbó achieved success in Latin music, originating from Pará.[479] Bossa nova is also a well-known style of Brazilian music developed and popularized in the 1950s and 1960s.[480] The phrase "bossa nova" means literally 'new trend'.[481] A lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, bossa nova acquired a large following starting in the 1960s.[482]

        Literature
        Main article: Brazilian literature

        Machado de Assis, poet and novelist, founder of the Brazilian Academy of Letters
        Brazilian literature dates back to the 16th century, to the writings of the first Portuguese explorers in Brazil, such as Pero Vaz de Caminha, filled with descriptions of fauna, flora and commentary about the indigenous population that fascinated European readers.[483]

        Brazil produced significant works in Romanticism—novelists such as Joaquim Manuel de Macedo and José de Alencar wrote novels about love and pain. Alencar, in his long career, also treated indigenous people as heroes in the Indigenist novels O Guarani, Iracema and Ubirajara.[484] Machado de Assis, one of his contemporaries, wrote in virtually all genres and continues to gain international prestige from critics worldwide.[485][486][487]

        Brazilian Modernism, evidenced by the Modern Art Week in 1922, was concerned with a nationalist avant-garde literature,[488] while Post-Modernism brought a generation of distinct poets such as João Cabral de Melo Neto, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Vinicius de Moraes, Cora Coralina, Graciliano Ramos, Cecília Meireles, and internationally known writers dealing with universal and regional subjects such as Jorge Amado, João Guimarães Rosa, Clarice Lispector and Manuel Bandeira.[489][490][491]

        Brazil's most significant literary award is the Camões Prize, which it shares with the rest of the Portuguese-speaking world. As of 2016, Brazil has eleven recipients of the prize.[492] Brazil also holds its own literary academy, the Brazilian Academy of Letters, a non-profit cultural organization aimed at perpetuating the care of the national language and literature.[493]

        Theatre

        The theatre in Brazil has its origins in the period of Jesuit expansion, when theater was used for the dissemination of Catholic doctrine in the 16th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries, dramatists on the scene of European derivation were for court or private performances.[494] During the 19th century, the playwrights Antônio Gonçalves Dias and Luís Carlos Martins Pena were known for their performance.[495] There were also numerous operas and orchestras. The Brazilian conductor Antônio Carlos Gomes became internationally known with operas such as Il Guarany. At the end of the 19th century, orchestrated dramaturgias were accompanied with songs of famous artists such as the conductress Chiquinha Gonzaga.[496]

        Already in the early 20th century there was the presence of theaters, entrepreneurs and actor companies. In 1940, Paschoal Carlos Magno and his student's theater, the comedians group and the Italian actors Adolfo Celi, Ruggero Jacobbi and Aldo Calvo, founders of the Teatro Brasileiro de Comédia, renewed the Brazilian theater. From the 1960s, it was attended by a theater dedicated to social and religious issues. The most prominent authors at this stage were Jorge Andrade and Ariano Suassuna.[495]

        Cinema
        Main article: Cinema of Brazil

        Gramado Film Festival, the biggest film festival in the country
        The Brazilian film industry began in the late 19th century, during the early days of the Belle Époque. While there were national film productions during the early 20th century, American films such as Rio the Magnificent were made in Rio de Janeiro to promote tourism in the city.[497] The films Limite (1931) and Ganga Bruta (1933), the latter being produced by Adhemar Gonzaga through the prolific studio Cinédia, were poorly received at release and failed at the box office, but are acclaimed nowadays and placed among the finest Brazilian films of all time.[498] The 1941 unfinished film It's All True was divided into four segments, two of which were filmed in Brazil and directed by Orson Welles; it was originally produced as part of the United States' Good Neighbor Policy during Getúlio Vargas' Estado Novo.

        During the 1960s, the Cinema Novo movement rose to prominence with directors such as Glauber Rocha, Nelson Pereira dos Santos, Paulo César Saraceni and Arnaldo Jabor. Glauber Rocha's films Black God, White Devil (1964) and Entranced Earth (1967) are considered to be some of the greatest and most influential in Brazilian film history.[499] Rocha won the Prix de la mise en scène at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival for Antonio das Mortes and the 1977 Special Jury Prize for Best Short Film for Di.

        During the 1990s, Brazil saw a surge of critical and commercial success with films such as O Quatrilho (Fábio Barreto, 1995), O Que É Isso, Companheiro? (Bruno Barreto, 1997) and Central do Brasil (Walter Salles, 1998), all of which were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the latter receiving a Best Actress nomination for Fernanda Montenegro. The 2002 crime film City of God, directed by Fernando Meirelles, was critically acclaimed, scoring 90% on Rotten Tomatoes,[500] being placed in Roger Ebert's Best Films of the Decade list[501] and receiving four Academy Award nominations in 2004, including Best Director. Notable film festivals in Brazil include the São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro International Film Festivals and the Gramado Festival.

        The film I'm Still Here, directed by Walter Salles, was nominated for Best Actress (Torres) and Best Picture at the 97th Academy Awards,[502][503][504] and won Best International Feature Film, becoming the first-ever Brazilian produced film to win an Academy Award.[505] The film The Secret Agent had its world premiere at the main competition of the 2025 Cannes Film Festival on 18 May 2025, where it won the Best Actor prize for Wagner Moura, the Best Director prize for Mendonça and the FIPRESCI Prize. It received further widespread critical acclaim.[506]

        The Brazilian press was officially born in Rio de Janeiro on 13 May 1808 with the creation of the Royal Printing National Press by the Prince Regent John.[508] The Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro, the first newspaper published in the country, began to circulate on 10 September 1808.[509] The largest newspapers nowadays are Folha de S.Paulo, O Globo, and O Estado de S. Paulo.[510]

        Radio broadcasting began on 7 September 1922, with a speech by then President Epitácio Pessoa, and was formalized on 20 April 1923 with the creation of the "Radio Society of Rio de Janeiro".[511] Television in Brazil began officially on 18 September 1950, with the founding of TV Tupi by Assis Chateaubriand.[512] Since then, television has grown in the country, creating large commercial broadcast networks such as Globo, SBT, RecordTV, Bandeirantes and RedeTV.

        By the mid-1960s, Brazilian universities had installed mainframe computers from IBM and Burroughs Large Systems. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Brazilian government restricted foreign imports to protect the local manufacturing of computers. In the 1980s, Brazil produced half of the computers sold in the country. By 2009, the mobile phone and Internet use in Brazil was the fifth largest in the world.[513]

        In May 2010, the Brazilian government launched TV Brasil Internacional, an international television station, initially broadcasting to 49 countries.[514] Commercial television channels broadcast internationally include Globo Internacional, RecordTV Internacional and Band Internacional.

        Cuisine

        Feijoada is the national dish of Brazilian cuisine
        Brazilian cuisine varies greatly by region, reflecting the country's varying mix of indigenous and immigrant populations. This has created a national cuisine marked by the preservation of regional differences.[515] Some of the most well known Brazilian foods are the feijoada, considered the country's national dish;[516] and churrasco, a kind of barbecue which is often served in rodízio style. Other regional foods include beijú, feijão tropeiro, vatapá, moqueca, polenta (from Italian cuisine) and acarajé (from African cuisine).[517] The national beverage is coffee; cachaça is Brazil's native liquor. Cachaça is distilled from sugar cane and is the main ingredient in the national cocktail, Caipirinha.[518]

        A typical meal consists mostly of rice and beans with beef, salad, french fries and a fried egg.[519] Often, it is mixed with cassava flour (farofa). Fried potatoes, fried cassava, fried banana, fried meat and fried cheese are very often eaten in lunch and served in most typical restaurants.[520] Popular snacks are pastel (a fried pastry); coxinha (a variation of chicken croquete); pão de queijo (cheese bread and cassava flour / tapioca); pamonha (corn and milk paste); esfirra (a variation of Lebanese pastry); kibbeh (from Arabic cuisine); and empada (pastry), little salt pies filled with shrimps or heart of palm.

        Brazil has a variety of desserts such as brigadeiros (chocolate fudge balls), bolo de rolo (roll cake with goiabada), cocada (a coconut sweet), beijinhos (coconut truffles and clove) and Romeu e Julieta (cheese with goiabada). Peanuts are used to make paçoca, rapadura and pé de moleque. Local common fruits such as açaí, cupuaçu, mango, papaya, cocoa, cashew, guava, orange, lime, passionfruit, pineapple, and hog plum are turned in juices and used to make chocolates, ice pops and ice cream.[521]

        The most popular sport in Brazil is football.[524] The Brazilian men's national team is ranked among the best in the world according to the FIFA World Rankings, and has won the World Cup tournament a record five times.[525][526]

        Volleyball, basketball, auto racing and martial arts also has large audiences. The Brazil men's national volleyball team currently holds the titles of the World League, World Grand Champions Cup, World Championship and the World Cup. In auto racing, three Brazilian drivers have won the Formula One world championship eight times.[527][528][529] The country has also produced significant achievements in other sports such as sailing, swimming, tennis, surfing, skateboarding, MMA, gymnastics, boxing, judo, athletics and table tennis.

        Some sport variations have their origins in Brazil: beach football,[530] futsal (indoor football)[531] and footvolley emerged in Brazil as variations of football. In martial arts, Brazilians developed Capoeira,[532] Vale tudo[533] and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.[534]

        Brazil has hosted several high-profile international sporting events, such as the 1950 FIFA World Cup,[535] and recently has hosted the 2014 FIFA World Cup, 2019 Copa América and 2021 Copa América .[536] The São Paulo circuit, Autódromo José Carlos Pace, hosts the annual Grand Prix of Brazil.[537] São Paulo organized the IV Pan American Games in 1963, and Rio de Janeiro hosted the XV Pan American Games in 2007.[538] On 2 October 2009, Rio de Janeiro was selected to host the 2016 Olympic Games and 2016 Paralympic Games, making it the first South American city to host the games[539] and second in Latin America, after Mexico City. Furthermore, the country hosted the FIBA Basketball World Cups in 1954 and 1963. At the 1963 event, the Brazil national basketball team won one of its two world championship titles.[540]

        <p>Germany,[d] officially the Federal Republic of Germany,[e] is a country in Western and Central Europe. It lies between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea to the north and the Alps to the south. Its sixteen constituent states have a total population of over 82 million, making it the most populous member state of the European Union. Germany borders Denmark to the north; Poland and the Czech Republic to the east; Austria and Switzerland to the south; and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. The nation's capital and most populous city is Berlin and its main financial centre is Frankfurt; the largest urban area is the Ruhr.

        Settlement in the territory of modern Germany began in the Lower Paleolithic, with various tribes inhabiting it from the Neolithic onward, chiefly the Celts, with Germanic tribes inhabiting the north. Romans named the area Germania. In 962, the Kingdom of Germany formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the German Confederation was formed in 1815.

        Unification of Germany into the modern nation-state, led by Prussia, established the German Empire in 1871. After World War I and a revolution, the Empire was replaced by the Weimar Republic. The Nazi rise to power in 1933 led to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship, World War II, and the Holocaust. In 1949, after the war and Allied occupation, Germany was organised into two separate polities with limited sovereignty: the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), or West Germany, and the German Democratic Republic (GDR), or East Germany. The FRG was a founding member of the European Economic Community in 1951, while the GDR was a communist Eastern Bloc state and member of the Warsaw Pact. After the fall of the communist led-government in East Germany, German reunification saw the former East German states join the FRG on 3 October 1990.

        Germany is a developed country with a strong economy; it has the largest economy in Europe by nominal GDP. As a major force in several industrial, scientific and technological sectors, Germany is both the world's third-largest exporter and third-largest importer. Widely considered a great power, Germany is part of multiple international organisations and forums. It has the third-highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites: 55, of which 52 are cultural.

        Etymology
        Further information: Names of Germany, Germani, and Germania
        The English word Germany derives from the Latin Germania, which came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine.[13] The German term Deutschland, originally diutisciu land ('the German lands'), is derived from deutsch (cf. Dutch), which descended from Old High German diutisc 'of the people' (from diot or diota 'people'), originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants. This in turn descends from Proto-Germanic *þiudiskaz 'of the people' (see also the Latinised form Theodiscus), derived from *þeudō, descended from Proto-Indo-European *tewtéh₂- 'people', from which the word Teutons also originates.[14]

        Ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago.[15] The first non-modern human fossil (the Neanderthal) was discovered in the Neander Valley.[16] Similarly dated evidence of modern humans has been found in the Swabian Jura, including 42,000-year-old flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found,[17] the 40,000-year-old Lion Man,[18] and the 41,000-year-old Venus of Hohle Fels.[19][20]

        Basilica of Constantine in Trier (Augusta Treverorum), built in the 4th century
        The Germanic peoples are thought to have emerged from the Jastorf culture during the Nordic Bronze Age or early Iron Age.[21][22] From southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, they expanded south, east, and west, coming into contact with the Celtic, Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes.[23][24] Southern Germany was inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, who belonged to the wider La Tène culture. They were later assimilated by the Germanic conquerors.[25]

        Under Augustus, the Roman Empire began to invade lands inhabited by the Germanic tribes, creating a short-lived Roman province of Germania between the Rhine and Elbe rivers. In 9 AD, three Roman legions were defeated by Arminius in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.[26][27] The outcome of this battle dissuaded the Romans from their ambition of conquering Germania and is thus considered one of the most important events in European history.[28] By 100 AD, when Tacitus wrote Germania, Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus), occupying most of modern Germany.[29] However, Baden-Württemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hesse and the western Rhineland had been incorporated into Roman provinces.[30][31][32]

        Around 260, Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.[33] After the invasion of the Huns in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest: the Franks established the Frankish Kingdom and pushed east to subjugate Saxony and Bavaria. Areas of modern eastern Germany were inhabited by Western Slavic tribes.[30]

        East Francia and the Holy Roman Empire
        Main articles: East Francia and Holy Roman Empire

        East Francia in 843

        Martin Luther, born in Eisleben in 1483, challenged the indulgences of the Catholic Church, giving rise to the Reformation and Protestantism.
        Charlemagne founded the Carolingian Empire in 800; it was divided in 843.[34] The eastern successor kingdom of East Francia stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe river in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps.[34] Subsequently, the Holy Roman Empire emerged from it. The Ottonian rulers (919–1024) consolidated several major duchies.[35] In 996, Gregory V became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin Otto III, whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the Salian emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the Investiture Controversy.[36]

        Under the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138–1254), German princes encouraged German settlement to the south and east (Ostsiedlung).[37] Members of the Hanseatic League, mostly north German towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.[38] The population declined starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed by the Black Death of 1348–1350.[39] The Golden Bull issued in 1356 provided the constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors.[40]

        Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, laying the basis for the democratisation of knowledge.[41] In 1517, Martin Luther incited the Protestant Reformation and his translation of the Bible began the standardisation of the language; the 1555 Peace of Augsburg tolerated the "Evangelical" faith (Lutheranism), but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects (cuius regio, eius religio).[42] From the Cologne War through the Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands and significantly reduced the population.[43][44]

        The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the Imperial Estates.[43] The legal system initiated by a series of Imperial Reforms (approximately 1495–1555) provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger Imperial Diet.[45] The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI in 1740. Following the War of the Austrian Succession and the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Charles VI's daughter Maria Theresa ruled as empress consort when her husband, Francis I, became emperor.[46][47]

        From 1740, dualism between the Austrian Habsburg monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated German history. In 1772, 1793, and 1795, Prussia and Austria, along with the Russian Empire, agreed to the Partitions of Poland.[48][49] During the period of the French Revolutionary Wars, the Napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the Imperial Diet, most of the Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the Imperium was dissolved; France, Russia, Prussia, and the Habsburgs (Austria) competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars.[50]

        German Confederation and Empire
        Main articles: German question, German Confederation, Unification of Germany, German Empire, and German colonial empire

        The German Confederation in 1815
        Following the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna founded the German Confederation, a loose league of 39 sovereign states. The appointment of the emperor of Austria as the permanent president reflected the Congress's rejection of Prussia's rising influence. Disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich.[51][52] The Zollverein, a tariff union, furthered economic unity.[53] In light of revolutionary movements in Europe, intellectuals and commoners started the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, raising the German question. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, a temporary setback for the movement.[54]


        Berlin Palace, the main residence of the Kings of Prussia and German Emperors
        King William I appointed Otto von Bismarck as the Minister President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded the war with Denmark in 1864; the subsequent decisive Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation which excluded Austria. After the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the King of Prussia ruled as its Emperor (Kaiser), and Berlin became its capital.[55][56]

        In the Gründerzeit period following the unification of Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as chancellor of Germany secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances and avoiding war.[56] However, under Wilhelm II, Germany took an imperialistic course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries.[57] A dual alliance was created with the multinational realm of Austria-Hungary; the Triple Alliance of 1882 included Italy. Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances to protect against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.[58] At the Berlin Conference in 1884, Germany claimed several colonies including German East Africa, German South West Africa, Togoland, and Kamerun.[59] Later, Germany further expanded its colonial empire to include holdings in the Pacific and China.[60] The colonial government in South West Africa (present-day Namibia), from 1904 to 1908, carried out the annihilation of the local Herero and Nama peoples as punishment for an uprising;[61][62][63] this was the 20th century's first genocide.[62]

        The assassination of Austria's crown prince on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for Austria-Hungary to attack Serbia and trigger World War I. After four years of warfare, in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed,[64] a general armistice ended the fighting. In the German Revolution (November 1918), Wilhelm II and the ruling princes abdicated their positions, and Germany was declared a federal republic. Germany's new leadership signed the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, accepting defeat by the Allies. Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating, which was seen by historians as influential in the rise of Adolf Hitler.[65] Germany lost around 13% of its European territory and ceded all of its colonial possessions.[66]

        Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany
        Main articles: Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany

        Adolf Hitler, dictatorial Führer of Nazi Germany from 1933 until his suicide in 1945
        On 11 August 1919, President Friedrich Ebert signed the democratic Weimar Constitution.[67] Communists briefly seized power in Bavaria and a few larger cities, while conservative elements failed to overthrow the central government in the 1920 Kapp Putsch. The occupation of the Ruhr by Belgian and French troops and a period of hyperinflation followed. A plan to restructure Germany's war reparations and the creation of a new currency in 1924 helped stabilise the government and ushered in the Golden Twenties, an era of artistic innovation and liberal cultural life.[68][69][70]

        The worldwide Great Depression hit Germany in 1929, and by 1932 the unemployment rate had risen to 24%.[71] The Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler became the largest party in the Reichstag after the election of July 1932, and President Hindenburg appointed Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933.[72] After the Reichstag fire, a decree abrogated basic civil rights, and the first Nazi concentration camp opened.[73][74] On 23 March 1933, the Enabling Act gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power, overriding the constitution,[75] and marked the beginning of Nazi Germany. His government established a centralised totalitarian state, withdrew from the League of Nations, and dramatically increased the country's rearmament.[76] A government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works, the most famous of which was the Autobahn.[77]

        In 1935, the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the Nuremberg Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities.[78] Germany also reacquired control of the Saarland in 1935,[79] remilitarised the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, annexed the Sudetenland in 1938 with the Munich Agreement, and, in violation of the agreement, occupied Czechoslovakia in March 1939.[80] Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) saw the burning of synagogues, the destruction of Jewish businesses, and mass arrests of Jewish people.[81]

        In August 1939, Hitler's government negotiated the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence.[82] On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, beginning World War II in Europe;[83] Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September.[84] In the spring of 1940, Germany conquered Denmark and Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, forcing the French government to sign an armistice. The British repelled German air attacks in the Battle of Britain in the same year. In 1941, German troops invaded Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Union. By 1942, Germany and its allies controlled most of continental Europe and North Africa, but following the Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, the Allied reconquest of North Africa and invasion of Italy in 1943, German forces suffered repeated military defeats. In 1944, the Soviets pushed into Eastern Europe; the Western allies landed in France and entered Germany despite a final German counteroffensive. Following Hitler's suicide during the Battle of Berlin, Germany signed the surrender document on 8 May 1945, ending World War II in Europe[83][85] and Nazi Germany. Following the end of the war, surviving Nazi officials were tried for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.[86][87]

        In what later became known as the Holocaust, the German government persecuted minorities, including interning them in concentration and death camps across Europe. The regime systematically murdered around 6 million Jews, at least 130,000 Romani, 275,000 disabled, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses, thousands of homosexuals, and hundreds of thousands of political and religious opponents.[88] Nazi policies in German-occupied countries resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2.7 million Poles,[89] 1.3 million Ukrainians, 1 million Belarusians and 3.5 million Soviet prisoners of war.[90][86] German military casualties have been estimated at 5.3 million,[91] and around 900,000 German civilians died.[92] Around 12 million ethnic Germans were expelled from across Eastern Europe, and Germany lost roughly one-quarter of its pre-war territory.[93]

        East and West Germany
        Main articles: History of Germany (1945–1990), Allied-occupied Germany, West Germany, and East Germany

        The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was one of the first developments in the end of the Cold War, leading ultimately to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
        After the surrender of Nazi Germany, the Allies de jure abolished the German state and partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) (German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR) (Deutsche Demokratische Republik; DDR). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany.[94] East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was temporary.[95]

        West Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a social market economy. In 1948, West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the American Marshall Plan.[96] Konrad Adenauer was elected the first federal chancellor of Germany in 1949. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth (Wirtschaftswunder) beginning in the early 1950s.[97] West Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community.[98] On 1 January 1957, the Saarland joined West Germany.[99]

        East Germany was an Eastern Bloc state under political and military control by the Soviet Union via occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact. Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (Politbüro) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany, supported by the Stasi, an immense secret service.[100] While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.[101] The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany, becoming a symbol of the Cold War.[102]

        Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the late 1960s by Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik.[103] In 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the Iron Curtain and open its border with Austria, causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary and Austria. This had devastating effects on the GDR, where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support. In an effort to help retain East Germany as a state, the East German authorities eased border restrictions, but this actually led to an acceleration of the Wende reform process, culminating in the Two Plus Four Treaty under which Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR.[104] The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 became a symbol of the Fall of Communism, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, German reunification and Die Wende ("the turning point").[105]

        Reunified Germany and the European Union
        Main articles: German reunification and History of Germany since 1990

        The Berlin/Bonn Act made Berlin the capital of Germany again, with the Reichstag becoming the seat of the German parliament in 1999.
        United Germany was considered the enlarged continuation of West Germany, so it retained its memberships in international organisations.[106] Based on the Berlin/Bonn Act (1994), Berlin again became the capital of Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a Bundesstadt (federal city), retaining some federal ministries.[107] The relocation of the government was completed in 1999,[108] and modernisation of the East German economy was scheduled to last until 2019.[109]

        Since reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union, signing the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the Lisbon Treaty in 2007,[110] and co-founding the eurozone.[111] Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban.[112][113]

        In the 2005 elections, Angela Merkel became the first female chancellor. In 2009, the German government approved a €50 billion stimulus plan.[114] Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of European integration, the country's energy transition (Energiewende) for a sustainable energy supply, the debt brake for balanced budgets, measures to increase the fertility rate (pronatalism), and high-tech strategies for the transition of the German economy, summarised as Industry 4.0.[115] During the 2015 European migrant crisis, the country took in over a million refugees and migrants.[116]

        Geography
        Main article: Geography of Germany

        A physical map of Germany
        Germany is the seventh-largest country in Europe.[117] It borders Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. Germany is also bordered by the North Sea and, at the north-northeast, by the Baltic Sea. German territory covers 357,022 km2 (137,847 sq mi).[5] Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (with the highest point being the Zugspitze at 2,963 metres or 9,721 feet) in the south to the shores of the North Sea (Nordsee) in the northwest and the Baltic Sea (Ostsee) in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: in the municipality Neuendorf-Sachsenbande, Wilstermarsch, at 3.54 metres or 11.6 feet below sea level[118]) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe. Significant natural resources include iron ore, coal, potash, timber, lignite, uranium, copper, natural gas, salt, and nickel.[117]

        Climate
        Most of Germany has a temperate climate, ranging from oceanic in the north and west to continental in the east and southeast. Winters range from cold in the Southern Alps to cool and are generally overcast with limited precipitation, while summers can vary from hot and dry to cool and rainy. The northern regions have prevailing westerly winds that bring in moist air from the North Sea, moderating the temperature and increasing precipitation. Conversely, the southeast regions have more extreme temperatures.[119]

        From February 2019–February 2020, average monthly temperatures in Germany ranged from a low of 3.3 °C (37.9 °F) in January 2020 to a high of 19.8 °C (67.6 °F) in June 2019.[120] Average monthly precipitation ranged from 30 litres per square metre in February and April 2019 to 125 litres per square metre in February 2020.[121] Average monthly hours of sunshine ranged from 45 in November 2019 to 300 in June 2019.[122]

        Climate change in Germany is leading to long-term impacts on agriculture, more intense heat waves and cold waves, flash and coastal flooding, and reduced water availability.[123] These changes could cost Germany up to €900 billion by 2050.[124]

        Biodiversity

        Berchtesgaden National Park in Bavaria
        The territory of Germany can be divided into five terrestrial ecoregions: Atlantic mixed forests, Baltic mixed forests, Central European mixed forests, Western European broadleaf forests, and Alps conifer and mixed forests.[125] As of 2016, 51% of Germany's land area is devoted to agriculture, while 30% is forested and 14% is covered by settlements or infrastructure.[126]

        Plants and animals include those generally common to Central Europe. According to the National Forest Inventory, beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute just over 40% of the forests; roughly 60% are conifers, particularly spruce and pine.[127] There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include roe deer, wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver.[128] The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol.[129]

        The 16 national parks in Germany include the Jasmund National Park, the Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park, the Müritz National Park, the Wadden Sea National Parks, the Harz National Park, the Hainich National Park, the Black Forest National Park, the Saxon Switzerland National Park, the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Berchtesgaden National Park.[130] In addition, there are 17 Biosphere Reserves,[131] and 105 nature parks.[132] More than 400 zoos and animal parks operate in Germany.[133] The Berlin Zoo, which opened in 1844, is the oldest in Germany, and claims the most comprehensive collection of species in the world.[134]

        Politics
        Main articles: Politics of Germany, Taxation in Germany, and Federal budget of Germany

        Frank-Walter Steinmeier
        President

        Friedrich Merz
        Chancellor
        Germany is a federal, parliamentary, representative democratic republic.[117] Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the Bundestag (Federal Diet) and Bundesrat (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The Bundestag is elected through direct elections using the mixed-member proportional representation system. The members of the Bundesrat represent and are appointed by the governments of the sixteen federated states.[117] The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitution known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law, are valid in perpetuity.[135]

        The president, who has been Frank-Walter Steinmeier since 2017, is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the Bundesversammlung (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates.[117] The second-highest official in the German order of precedence is the Bundestagspräsident (president of the Bundestag), who is elected by the Bundestag and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.[136] The third-highest official and the head of government is the chancellor, who is appointed by the Bundespräsident after being elected by the party or coalition with the most seats in the Bundestag.[117] The chancellor, who has been Friedrich Merz since 2025, is the head of government and exercises executive power through his Cabinet.[117]

        Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party and the Alliance 90/The Greens have also been junior partners in coalition governments. Since 2007, the democratic socialist party The Left has been a staple in the German Bundestag, though they have never been part of the federal government.[137] In the 2017 German federal election, the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.[138]

        Constituent states
        Main articles: States of Germany, Federalism in Germany, and List of current heads of government of the German federal states
        Germany is a federation and comprises sixteen constituent states which are collectively referred to as Länder.[139] Each state (Land) has its own constitution,[140] and is largely autonomous in regard to its internal organisation.[139] As of 2017, Germany is divided into 401 districts (Kreise) at a municipal level; these consist of 294 rural districts and 107 urban districts.[141]

        Law
        Main articles: Law of Germany, Judiciary of Germany, and Law enforcement in Germany
        Germany has a civil law system based on Roman law with some references to Germanic law.[145] The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review.[146] Germany's specialised supreme court system includes the Federal Court of Justice for civil and criminal cases, along with the Federal Labour Court, Federal Social Court, Federal Fiscal Court, and Federal Administrative Court for other matters.[147]

        Criminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the Strafgesetzbuch and the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch respectively. The German penal system seeks the rehabilitation of the criminal and the protection of the public.[148] With the exceptions of petty crimes, tried by a single professional judge, and of serious political crimes, all charges are adjudicated by mixed tribunals where lay judges (Schöffen) and professional judges preside together.[149][150]

        In 2016, Germany's murder rate stood at a low of 1.18 murders per 100,000.[151] In 2018, the overall crime rate in the country fell to its lowest since 1992,[152] while in 2024, it was reported that violent crime reached a 15-year high, with overall crime rising as well.[153]

        Same-sex marriage in Germany has been legal since 2017, and LGBT rights in the country are generally protected.[154]

        Foreign relations
        Main article: Foreign relations of Germany

        Germany hosted the 2022 G7 summit at Schloss Elmau in Bavaria.
        Germany has a network of 227 diplomatic missions abroad[155] and maintains relations with more than 190 countries.[156] Germany is a member of the Council of Europe, NATO, the OECD, the G7, the G20, the World Bank and the IMF. It has played an influential role in the European Union since its inception and has maintained a strong alliance with France and all neighbouring countries since 1990. Germany promotes the creation of a more unified European political, economic and security apparatus.[157][158][159] Because of its economic power and political influence, Germany is widely considered to be a great power.[160][161]

        The governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies.[162] Cultural ties and economic interests have crafted a bond between the two countries resulting in Atlanticism.[163]

        After 1990, Germany and Russia worked together to establish a "strategic partnership" in which energy development became one of the most important factors.[164] As a result of the cooperation, Germany imported most of its natural gas and crude oil from Russia.[165]

        Germany's development policy functions as a distinct sector within its foreign policy framework. It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and carried out by the implementing organisations. The German government sees development policy as a joint responsibility of the international community.[166] It was the world's second-biggest aid donor in 2019 after the United States.[167]

        Military
        Main article: Bundeswehr

        A German TPz Fuchs armoured personnel carrier
        Germany's military, the Bundeswehr (Federal Defence), is organised into the Heer (Army and special forces KSK), Marine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air Force) and Cyber- und Informationsraum (Cyber and Information Domain Service) branches.[168] In absolute terms, German military spending in 2023 was the seventh-highest in the world.[169] In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that German military expenditure would be increased past the NATO target of 2%, along with a one-time 2022 infusion of 100 billion euros, representing almost double the 53 billion euro military budget for 2021.[170][171] In 2023, military spending according to NATO criteria amounted to $73.1 billion, or 1.64% of the country's GDP, well below the NATO target of 2%. In 2024, Germany reported $97.7 billion to NATO, exceeding the NATO target of 2% at 2.12% of GDP.[172]

        As of May 2024, the Bundeswehr has a strength of 180,215 active soldiers and 80,761 civilians.[173] Reservists are available to the armed forces and participate in defence exercises and deployments abroad.[174] Until 2011, military service was compulsory for men at age 18, but this has been officially suspended and replaced with a voluntary service.[175][176] Since 2001 women may serve in all functions of service without restriction.[177] According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Germany was the fifth-largest exporter of major arms in the world from 2020 to 2024.[178]

        In peacetime, the Bundeswehr is commanded by the Minister of Defence. In a state of defence, the Chancellor would become commander-in-chief of the Bundeswehr.[179] The role of the Bundeswehr is described in the Constitution of Germany as defensive only. But after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994, the term "defence" has been defined not only to include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world. As of 2017, the German military has about 3,600 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces, including about 1,200 supporting operations against Daesh, 980 in the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, and 800 in Kosovo.[180][181]

        High-speed trains like this ICE 3 connect the whole of Germany.
        With its central position in Europe, Germany is a transport hub for the continent.[214] Its road network is among the densest in Europe.[215] The motorway (Autobahn) is widely known for having no general federally mandated speed limit for some classes of vehicles.[216] The Intercity Express or ICE train network serves major German cities as well as destinations in neighbouring countries with speeds up to 300 km/h (190 mph).[217] The largest German airports are Frankfurt Airport, Munich Airport and Berlin Brandenburg Airport.[218] The Port of Hamburg is the third-busiest port in Europe and one of the twenty largest container ports in the world.[219]

        In 2019, Germany was the world's seventh-largest consumer of energy.[220] All German nuclear power plants were phased out in 2023.[221] Germany meets its power demands using 40% renewable sources (2018),[222] and has been called an "early leader" in solar panels and offshore wind.[223] The country is committed to the Paris Agreement and several other treaties promoting biodiversity,[224] low emission standards,[225] and water management.[226] As of 2017, Germany's household recycling rate is among the highest in the world—at around 65%.[227] In 2023, Germany was the 14th highest emitting nation of greenhouse gases.[228] The German energy transition (Energiewende) is the recognised move to a sustainable economy by means of energy efficiency and renewable energy,[229][223] with the country being called "the world's first major renewable energy economy".[230] Germany has reduced its primary energy consumption by 11% between 1990 and 2015[231] and set itself goals of reducing it by 30% until 2030 and 50% by 2050.[232]

        Domestic and international travel and tourism combined directly contributed over €105.3 billion to German GDP in 2015.[233] Including indirect and induced impacts, the industry supported nearly 4.2 million jobs in 2015.[233] As of 2024, Germany is the seventh-most-visited country.[234] Its most popular landmarks include Cologne Cathedral, the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, the Dresden Frauenkirche, Neuschwanstein Castle, Heidelberg Castle, the Wartburg, and Sanssouci Palace.[235] Europa-Park near Freiburg is Europe's second-most popular theme park resort.[236]

        Demographics
        Main articles: Demographics of Germany and Germans
        With a population of 84.7 million according to the 2023 German census,[237] Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union, the second-most populous country in Europe[f] after Russia,[117] and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. Its population density stands at 236 inhabitants per square kilometre (610 inhabitants/sq mi). The fertility rate of 1.57 children born per woman (2022 estimates) is below the replacement rate of 2.1 and is one of the lowest in the world.[117] Since the 1970s, Germany's death rate has exceeded its birth rate. However, Germany is witnessing increased birth rates and migration rates since the beginning of the 2010s. Germany has the third oldest population in the world, with an average age of 47.4 years.[117]


        Hamburg is Germany's second-most populous city, with its seaport being the country's largest by volume.
        Four sizeable groups of people are referred to as national minorities because their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries:[239] There is a Danish minority in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein;[239] the Sorbs, a Slavic population, are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg; the Roma and Sinti live throughout the country; and the Frisians are concentrated in Schleswig-Holstein's western coast and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony.[239]

        Germany is a major destination for immigrants, ranking second in the world after the United States.[240] In 2015, following the 2015 refugee crisis, the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs listed Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide, about 5% or 12 million of all 244 million migrants.[241] Refugee crises have resulted in substantial population increases;[242] for example, the major influx of Ukrainian immigrants following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, whereby over 1.06 million refugees from Ukraine were recorded in Germany as of April 2023.[243] In 2019, Germany ranked seventh among EU countries in terms of the percentage of migrants in the country's population, at 13.1%.[244] In 2022, there were 23.8 million people—28.7 percent of the total population—who had a migration background.[245]

        Germany has a number of large cities. There are 11 officially recognised metropolitan regions. The country's largest city is Berlin, while its largest urban area is the Ruhr.[246]

        Cologne Cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage Site
        According to the 2022 census, Christianity is the largest religion at 49.7% of the population; 23.1% identified as Protestant and 25.1% as Catholic.[248]

        A study in 2023 estimated that 46.2% of the population are not members of any religious organisation or denomination and that a majority of the population no longer belongs to a Christian denomination (48.5% Christians).[249] Irreligion in Germany is strongest in major metropolitan areas and throughout the former East Germany, which used to be predominantly Protestant before the imposition of state atheism under communism.[250][251]

        Islam is the second-largest religion in the country.[252] In the 2011 census, 1.9% of respondents (1.52 million people) gave their religion as Islam, but this figure is deemed unreliable because a disproportionate number of adherents of this faith (and other religions, such as Judaism) are likely to have made use of their right not to answer the question.[253] In 2019, there were an estimated 5.3–5.6 million Muslims with a migrant background[g] (6.4–6.7% of the population), in addition to an unknown number of Muslims without a migrant background.[254] Most of the Muslims are Sunnis and Alevis from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites, Ahmadiyyas and other denominations. Other religions each comprise less than one percent of Germany's population.[252]

        In 2011, formal members of the Jewish community represented no more than 0.2% of the total German population, and 60% of them resided in Berlin.[255] An estimated 80 to 90 percent of these Jews in Germany are Russian-speaking immigrants from the former Soviet Union who came to Germany from the 1980s onwards.[256][257]

        Languages

        German is the official and predominantly spoken language in Germany.[258] It is one of 24 official and working languages of the European Union, and one of the three procedural languages of the European Commission, alongside English and French.[259] German is the most widely spoken first language in the European Union, with around 100 million native speakers.[260]

        Recognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish, Low German, Low Rhenish, Sorbian, Romani, North Frisian and Saterland Frisian; they are officially protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The most used immigrant languages are Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, Polish, Italian, Greek, Spanish, Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian and other Balkan languages, as well as Russian. Germans are typically multilingual: 67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two.[258]

        Education
        Main article: Education in Germany

        Heidelberg University, Germany's oldest institution of higher learning and generally considered one of its most renowned
        Responsibility for educational supervision in Germany is primarily organised within the individual states. Optional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years depending on the state. Primary education usually lasts for four to six years.[261] Secondary schooling is divided into tracks based on whether students pursue academic or vocational education.[262] A system of apprenticeship called Duale Ausbildung leads to a skilled qualification which is almost comparable to an academic degree. It allows students in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run trade school.[261] This model is well regarded and reproduced all around the world.[263]

        Most of the German universities are public institutions, and students traditionally study without fee payment.[264] The general requirement for attending university is the Abitur. According to an OECD report in 2014, Germany is the world's third leading destination for international study.[265] The established universities in Germany include some of the oldest in the world, with Heidelberg University (established in 1386), Leipzig University (established in 1409) and the University of Rostock (established in 1419) being the oldest in the country.[266] The Humboldt University of Berlin, founded in 1810 by the liberal educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt, became the academic model for many Western universities.[267][268] In the contemporary era, Germany has developed eleven Universities of Excellence.

        Health
        Main article: Healthcare in Germany

        The Hospital of the Holy Spirit in Lübeck, established in 1286, is a precursor to modern hospitals.[269]
        Germany's system of hospitals, called Krankenhäuser, dates from medieval times, and the country has the world's oldest universal health care system, dating from Bismarck's social legislation of the 1880s.[270] Since the 1880s, reforms and provisions have ensured a balanced health care system. The population is covered by a health insurance plan provided by statute, with criteria allowing some groups to opt for a private health insurance contract. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Germany's health care system was 77% government-funded and 23% privately funded in 2013.[271] In 2014, Germany spent 11.3% of its GDP on health care.[272]

        Germany ranked 21st in the world in 2019 in life expectancy with 78.7 years for men and 84.8 years for women according to the WHO, and it had a very low infant mortality rate of 4 deaths per 1,000 live births. In 2019, the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 37%.[273] Obesity in Germany has been increasingly cited as a major health issue: a 2014 study showed that 52 percent of the adult German population was overweight or obese.[274]

        Culture
        Main article: Culture of Germany

        The Striezelmarkt, a Christmas market in Dresden
        Culture in German states has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular, and their scientists, writers and philosophers have played a significant role in the development of Western thought.[275] Global opinion polls from the BBC revealed that Germany is recognised for having the most positive influence in the world in 2013[276] and 2014.[277]

        Germany is well known for such folk festivals as the Oktoberfest and Christmas customs, which include Advent wreaths, Christmas pageants, Christmas trees, Stollen cakes, and other practices.[278][279] As of 2025, UNESCO inscribed 55 properties in Germany on the World Heritage List.[280] There are a number of public holidays in Germany determined by each state; 3 October has been a national day of Germany since 1990, celebrated as the Tag der Deutschen Einheit (German Unity Day).[281]

        Music

        Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827), one of the most famed composers of classical music, was born in Bonn.
        German classical music includes works by some of the world's most well-known composers. Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel were influential composers of the Baroque period. Ludwig van Beethoven was a crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras. Carl Maria von Weber, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms were significant Romantic composers. Richard Wagner was known for his operas. Richard Strauss was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Wolfgang Rihm are important composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries.[282]

        In 2013, Germany was the second-largest music market in Europe, and fourth-largest in the world.[283] German popular music of the 20th and 21st centuries includes the movements of Neue Deutsche Welle, pop, Ostrock, heavy metal/rock, punk, pop rock, indie, Volksmusik (folk music), schlager pop and German hip hop. German electronic music gained global influence, with Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream pioneering in this genre.[284] DJs and artists of the techno and house music scenes of Germany have become well known (e.g. Paul van Dyk, Felix Jaehn, Paul Kalkbrenner, Robin Schulz and Scooter).[285]

        German painters have influenced Western art. Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Matthias Grünewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German artists of the Renaissance, Johann Baptist Zimmermann of the Baroque, Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Spitzweg of Romanticism, Max Liebermann of Impressionism and Max Ernst of Surrealism. Several German art groups formed in the 20th century; Die Brücke (The Bridge) and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) influenced the development of expressionism in Munich and Berlin. The New Objectivity arose in response to expressionism during the Weimar Republic. After World War II, broad trends in German art include neo-expressionism and the New Leipzig School.[286]

        German designers became early leaders of modern product design.[287] The Berlin Fashion Week and the fashion trade fair Bread & Butter are held twice a year.[288]

        Architectural contributions from Germany include the Carolingian and Ottonian styles, which were precursors of Romanesque. Brick Gothic is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in Renaissance and Baroque art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. Weser Renaissance).[286] Vernacular architecture in Germany is often identified by its timber framing (Fachwerk) traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles.[289] When industrialisation spread across Europe, classicism and a distinctive style of historicism developed in Germany, sometimes referred to as Gründerzeit style. Expressionist architecture developed in the 1910s in Germany and influenced Art Deco and other modern styles. Germany was particularly important in the early modernist movement: it is the home of Werkbund initiated by Hermann Muthesius (New Objectivity), and of the Bauhaus movement founded by Walter Gropius.[286] Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century; he conceived of the glass façade skyscraper.[290] Renowned contemporary architects and offices include Pritzker Prize winners Gottfried Böhm and Frei Otto.[291]

        Literature and philosophy
        Main articles: German literature and German philosophy

        Brothers Grimm, who collected popular German folk tales and published them in a collection
        German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach. Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane. The collections of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm popularised German folklore on an international level.[292] The Grimms also gathered and codified regional variants of the German language, grounding their work in historical principles; their Deutsches Wörterbuch, or German Dictionary, sometimes called the Grimm dictionary, was begun in 1838 and the first volumes published in 1854.[293]

        Influential authors of the 20th century include Gerhart Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Heinrich Böll, and Günter Grass.[294] The German book market is the third-largest in the world, after the United States and China.[295] The Frankfurt Book Fair is the most important in the world for international deals and trading, with a tradition spanning over 500 years.[296] The Leipzig Book Fair also retains a major position in Europe.[297]

        German philosophy is historically significant: Gottfried Leibniz's contributions to rationalism; the enlightenment philosophy by Immanuel Kant; the establishment of classical German idealism by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling; Arthur Schopenhauer's composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of communist theory by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels; Friedrich Nietzsche's development of perspectivism; Gottlob Frege's contributions to the dawn of analytic philosophy; Martin Heidegger's works on Being; Oswald Spengler's historical philosophy; and the development of the Frankfurt School have all been very influential.[298]

        Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam, the first large-scale film studio in the world
        The largest internationally operating media companies in Germany are Bertelsmann, Axel Springer SE and ProSiebenSat.1 Media. Germany's television market is the largest in Europe, with over 38 million TV households as of 2012.[299] Around 90% of German households have cable or satellite TV, with a variety of free-to-view public and commercial channels.[300] There are more than 300 public and private radio stations in Germany; Germany's national radio network is the Deutschlandradio, while the public Deutsche Welle is the main radio and television broadcaster in foreign languages.[300] Germany's print market of newspapers and magazines is the largest in Europe.[300] The papers with the highest circulation are Bild, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Die Welt.[300] The largest magazines include ADAC Motorwelt and Der Spiegel.[300] Germany has a large video gaming market, with over 34 million players nationwide.[301] The annual Gamescom held in Cologne is the world's largest gaming convention.[302]

        German cinema has made major technical and artistic contributions to film. The first works of the Skladanowsky Brothers were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world. Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Director Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) is referred to as the first major science-fiction film. After 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as Trümmerfilm (rubble film). East German film was dominated by the state-owned film studio DEFA, while the dominant genre in West Germany was the Heimatfilm ("homeland film").[303] During the 1970s and 1980s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder brought West German auteur cinema to critical acclaim.

        The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film ("Oscar") went to the German production The Tin Drum (Die Blechtrommel) in 1979, to Nowhere in Africa (Nirgendwo in Afrika) in 2002, and to The Lives of Others (Das Leben der Anderen) in 2007. Various Germans won an Oscar for their performances in other films. The annual European Film Awards ceremony is held every other year in Berlin, home of the European Film Academy. The Berlin International Film Festival, known as "Berlinale", awarding the "Golden Bear" and held annually since 1951, is one of the world's leading film festivals. The "Lolas" are annually awarded in Berlin, at the German Film Awards.[304]

International varieties such as pizza, sushi, Chinese food, Greek food, Indian cuisine, and doner kebab are popular as well.

        Bread is a significant part of German cuisine, with German bakeries producing about 600 main types of bread and 1,200 types of pastries and rolls (Brötchen).[305] German cheeses account for about 22% of all cheese produced in Europe.[306] In 2012 over 99% of all meat produced in Germany was either pork, chicken, or beef. Germans produce their ubiquitous sausages in almost 1,500 varieties, including Bratwurst and Weißwurst.[307]

        The national alcoholic drink is beer.[308] German beer consumption per capita stood at 110 litres (24 imp gal; 29 US gal) in 2013 and remains among the highest in the world.[309] German beer purity regulations date back to the 16th century.[310] Wine has become popular in many parts of the country, especially near the German wine regions.[311] In 2019, Germany was the ninth-largest wine producer in the world.[312]

        The 2018 Michelin Guide awarded eleven restaurants in Germany three stars, giving the country a cumulative total of 300 stars.[313]

        <p>Japan[a] is an island country in East Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean off the northeast coast of the Asian mainland, it is bordered to the west by the Sea of Japan and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea in the south. The Japanese archipelago consists of four major islands alongside 14,121 smaller islands. Divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions, about 75% of the country's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested, concentrating its agriculture and highly urbanized population along its eastern coastal plains. With a population of over 123 million as of 2025, it is the 11th most populous country. The country's capital and largest city is Tokyo.

        The first known habitation of the archipelago dates to the Upper Paleolithic, with the beginning of the Japanese Paleolithic dating to c. 36,000 BC. Between the 4th and 6th centuries, its kingdoms were united under an emperor in Nara and later Heian-kyō. From the 12th century, actual power was held by military aristocrats known as shōgun and feudal lords called daimyō, enforced by warrior nobility named samurai.[11] After rule by the Kamakura and Ashikaga shogunates and a century of warring states, Japan was unified in 1600 by the Tokugawa shogunate, which implemented an isolationist foreign policy. In 1853, an American fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868.

        In the Meiji period, Japan pursued rapid industrialization and modernization, as well as militarism and overseas colonization. The country annexed Korea in 1910, invaded China in 1937 and attacked the United States and European colonial powers in 1941, thus entering World War II as an Axis power. After being defeated in the Pacific War and suffering the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under Allied occupation. Afterwards, the country underwent rapid economic growth and became one of the five earliest major non-NATO allies of the U.S. Since the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in the early 1990s, it has experienced a prolonged period of economic stagnation referred to as the Lost Decades.

        Japan is a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature known as the National Diet. Widely considered a great power and the only Asian member of the G7, it maintains one of the world's strongest militaries but has constitutionally renounced its right to declare war. A developed country with one of the world's largest economies by nominal GDP, Japan is a global leader in the automotive, electronics, and robotics industries, in addition to making significant contributions to science and technology. It has one of the highest life expectancies, but is undergoing a severe population decline and has the highest proportion of elderly citizens of any country in the world. The culture of Japan is globally well known, especially its popular culture, which includes art, cuisine, films, music, animation, comics, and video games.

        Etymology
        Main article: Names of Japan
        The name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji 日本 and is pronounced Nihon or Nippon.[12] Before 日本 was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as Wa (倭, changed in Japan around 757 to 和) and in Japan by the endonym Yamato.[13] Nippon, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on Japanese banknotes and postage stamps.[12] Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period.[13] The characters 日本 mean "sun origin",[12] which is the source of the popular Western epithet "Land of the Rising Sun".[14]

        The name "Japan" is based on Min or Wu Chinese pronunciations of 日本 and was introduced to European languages through early trade.[15] In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the Early Mandarin Chinese pronunciation of the characters 日本國 as Cipangu.[16] The old Malay name for Japan, Japang or Japun, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century.[17] The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as Giapan in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.[18][15]

        History

        Prehistoric to classical history

        Legendary Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇, Jinmu-tennō)
        Modern humans arrived in Japan around 38,000 years ago (~36,000 BC), marking the beginning of the Japanese Paleolithic.[19] Around 14,500 BC (the start of the Jōmon period), a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture emerged.[20] Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery.[21] The Japonic-speaking Yayoi people later entered the archipelago from the Korean Peninsula,[22][23][24] intermingling with the Jōmon people.[24] The Yayoi period saw the introduction of innovative practices including wet-rice farming,[25] a new style of pottery,[26] and metallurgy from China and Korea.[27] According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (descendant of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line.[28]

        Japan first appears in written history in the Chinese Book of Han, completed in 111 AD, where it is described as having a hundred small kingdoms. A century later, the Book of Wei records that the kingdom of Yamatai (which may refer to Yamato) unified most of these kingdoms.[29][28] Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje (a Korean kingdom) in 552, but the development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China.[30] Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like Prince Shōtoku, and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592–710).[31]

        In 645, the government led by Prince Naka no Ōe and Fujiwara no Kamatari devised and implemented the far-reaching Taika Reforms. The Reform began with land reform, based on Confucian ideas and philosophies from China.[32] It nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation.[33] The true aim of the reforms was to bring about greater centralization and to enhance the power of the imperial court, which was also based on the governmental structure of China. Envoys and students were dispatched to China to learn about Chinese writing, politics, art, and religion.[32]

        The Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince Ōama and his nephew Prince Ōtomo, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms.[34] These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taihō Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments.[33] These legal reforms created the ritsuryō state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.[34]

        The Nara period (710–784) marked the emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heijō-kyō (modern Nara). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture.[35][36] A smallpox epidemic in 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.[36][37] In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital, settling on Heian-kyō (modern-day Kyoto) in 794.[36] This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794–1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged. Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem "Kimigayo" were written during this time.[38]

        Feudal era

        Three unifiers of Japan. Left to right: Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu.
        Japan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai.[39] In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan by the Minamoto clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura.[40] After Yoritomo's death, the Hōjō clan came to power as regents for the shōgun.[36] The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class.[41]

        The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo.[36] Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336–1573).[42] The succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimyō) and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period ("Warring States").[43]

        During the 16th century, Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West (see Nanban trade and Nanban art).[36][44] Oda Nobunaga used European technology and firearms to conquer many other daimyō;[45] his consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi–Momoyama period.[46] After the death of Nobunaga in 1582, his successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, unified the nation in the early 1590s and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.[36]

        Tokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son Toyotomi Hideyori within the Council of Five Elders and used his position to gain political and military support.[47] When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. He was appointed shōgun by Emperor Go-Yōzei in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo (modern Tokyo).[48] The shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimyō,[49] and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku ("closed country") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603–1868).[48][50] Modern Japan's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads (Kaidō) and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers.[51] The study of Western sciences (rangaku) continued through contact with the Dutch enclave in Nagasaki.[48] The Edo period gave rise to kokugaku ("national studies"), the study of Japan by the Japanese.[52]

        Modern era

        Emperor Meiji (明治天皇, Meiji-tennō); 1852–1912

        The Empire of Japan and its influence, 1942
        The United States Navy sent Commodore Matthew C. Perry to force the opening of Japan to the outside world. Arriving at Uraga with four "Black Ships" in July 1853, the Perry Expedition resulted in the March 1854 Convention of Kanagawa.[48] Subsequent similar treaties with other Western countries brought economic and political crises.[48] The resignation of the shōgun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the Meiji Restoration).[53] Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution (November 29, 1890), and assembled the Imperial Diet.[54]

        During the Meiji period (1868–1912), the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed state in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence.[55][56][57] After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin,[58][54] and annexed Korea in 1910.[59] The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization.[60][61]

        The early 20th century saw a period of Taishō democracy (1912–1926) overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization.[62][63] World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to capture German possessions in the Pacific and China in 1920.[63] The 1920s saw a political shift towards statism, a period of lawlessness following the 1923 Great Tokyo Earthquake, the passing of laws against political dissent, and a series of attempted coups.[61][64][65]

        This process accelerated in the 1930s, spawning several radical nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia.[66] In 1931, Japan invaded China and occupied Manchuria, which led to the establishment of puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932; following international condemnation of the occupation, it resigned from the League of Nations in 1933.[67] In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis powers.[61]


        On September 2, 1945, Japan surrendered to the Allies.
        The Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945).[68] In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan.[61][69] On December 7–8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, as well as on British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, among others, beginning World War II in the Pacific.[70] Throughout areas occupied by Japan during the war, numerous abuses were committed against local inhabitants. Many women were forced into sexual slavery.[71]

        After Allied victories during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender.[72] The war cost Japan millions of lives and many of its conquered territories, including de jure parts of Japan such as Korea, Taiwan, Karafuto, and the Kurils.[61] The Allies, led by the United States, repatriated millions of Japanese settlers from their former colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Empire of Japan and its influence over the territories it conquered.[73][74] The Allies convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders except the Emperor[75] for Japanese war crimes.[74]

        In 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices.[74] The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952,[76] and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956.[74] A period of record growth propelled Japan to become the world's second-largest economy at that time;[74] this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of an asset price bubble, beginning the "Lost Decade" characterized by economic stagnation and low inflation.[77] In 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history—the Tōhoku earthquake—triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.[78] On May 1, 2019, after the historic abdication of Emperor Akihito, his son Naruhito became Emperor, beginning the Reiwa era (2019-).[79]

        Geography
        Main articles: Geography of Japan and Geology of Japan

        A topographic map of Japan
        Japan comprises 14,125 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia.[80] It stretches over 3000 km (1900 mi) northeast–southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea.[81][82] The country's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa.[83] The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanpō Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago.[84] As of 2019, Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km2 (145,937.06 sq mi).[4] Japan has the sixth-longest coastline in the world at 29,751 km (18,486 mi). Because of its far-flung outlying islands, Japan's exclusive economic zone is the eighth-largest in the world, covering 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi).[85][86]

        The Japanese archipelago is 67% forests and 14% agricultural.[87] The primarily rugged and mountainous terrain is restricted for habitation.[88] Thus the habitable zones, mainly in the coastal areas, have very high population densities: Japan is the 40th most densely populated country even without considering that local concentration.[89][90] Honshu has the highest population density at 450 persons/km2 (1200/sq mi) as of 2010, while Hokkaido has the lowest density of 64.5 persons/km2 as of 2016.[91] As of 2014, approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land (umetatechi).[92] Lake Biwa is an ancient lake and the country's largest freshwater lake.[93]

        Japan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanic eruptions because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire.[94] It has the 17th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2016 World Risk Index.[95] Japan has 111 active volcanoes.[96] Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century;[97] the 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people.[98] More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami.[78]

        Climate
        Main article: Climate of Japan

        Mount Fuji and Shinkansen
        The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. The northernmost region, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.[99]

        In the Sea of Japan region on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall during winter. In the summer, the region sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the Foehn.[100] The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.[99]

        The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu and Nanpō Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.[99] The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.[101] According to the Environment Ministry, heavy rainfall and increasing temperatures have caused problems in the agricultural industry and elsewhere.[102] The highest temperature ever measured in Japan, 41.8 °C (107.2 °F), was recorded on August 5, 2025.[103]

        Biodiversity
        Main article: Wildlife of Japan
        Japan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.[104] Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife as of 2019,[105] including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the small Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander.[106] There are 53 Ramsar wetland sites in Japan.[107] Five sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.[108]

        Environment
        Main articles: Environmental issues in Japan and Climate change in Japan

        Autumn maple leaves (momiji) at Kongōbu-ji on Mount Kōya, a UNESCO World Heritage Site
        In the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concerns, the government introduced environmental protection laws in 1970.[109] The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.[110]

        Japan ranks 20th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a country's commitment to environmental sustainability.[111] Japan is the world's fifth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide.[102] As the host and signatory of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.[112] In 2020, the government of Japan announced a target of carbon-neutrality by 2050.[113] Environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.[114]

        Main articles: Government of Japan and Politics of Japan

        Naruhito
        Emperor

        Sanae Takaichi
        Prime Minister
        Japan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the emperor (Tennō) is limited to a ceremonial role.[115] Executive power is instead wielded by the prime minister and the Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people.[116] Naruhito is the Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019.[115]


        The National Diet Building
        Japan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament.[115] It consists of a lower House of Representatives with 465 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and an upper House of Councillors with 248 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms.[117] There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age,[118] with a secret ballot for all elected offices.[116] The prime minister as the head of government has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers of State, and is appointed by the emperor after being designated from among the members of the Diet.[117] Sanae Takaichi is Japan's prime minister; she took office after winning the 2025 Liberal Democratic Party leadership election and securing a confidence and supply agreement with Ishin.[119]

        Historically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki.[120] Since the late 19th century, the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. In 1896, Japan established a civil code based on the German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, which remains in effect with post–World War II modifications.[121] The Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947, is the oldest unamended constitution in the world.[122] Statutory law originates in the legislature, and the constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet without giving him the power to oppose legislation. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.[120] Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.[123]

        Administrative divisions
        Main articles: Administrative divisions of Japan and Prefectures of Japan
        Japan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor and legislature.[115] In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region:[124]

        Foreign relations
        Main article: Foreign relations of Japan

        Japan is a member of both the G7 and the G20.
        A member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan is one of the G4 countries seeking reform of the Security Council.[125] Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and "ASEAN Plus Three", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit.[126] It is the world's fifth-largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014.[127] In 2024, Japan had the fourth-largest diplomatic network in the world.[128] Japan is widely considered to be a great power due to its economic power and political, cultural, and military influence.[129][130]

        Japan has close economic and military relations with the United States, with which it maintains a security alliance.[131] The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and a major source of Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, with military bases in Japan.[131] In 2016, Japan announced the Free and Open Indo-Pacific vision, which frames its regional policies.[132][133] Japan is also a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue ("the Quad"), a multilateral security dialogue reformed in 2017 aiming to limit Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region, along with the United States, Australia, and India.[134][135]

        Japan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors. It contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands, which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945.[136] South Korea's control of the Liancourt Rocks is acknowledged but not accepted as they are claimed by Japan.[137] Japan has strained relations with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands and the status of Okinotorishima.[138]

        Military

        Japan is the third highest-ranked Asian country in the 2024 Global Peace Index.[139] It spent 1.4% of its total GDP on its defence budget and maintained the tenth-largest military budget in the world in 2024.[140] The country's military, the Japan Self-Defense Forces (SJDF), is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes.[141] The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The deployment of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II.[142]

        The Government of Japan has been making changes to its security policy which include the establishment of the National Security Council, the adoption of the National Security Strategy, and the development of the National Defense Program Guidelines.[143] In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security.[144] In December 2022, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida further confirmed this trend, instructing the government to increase spending by 65% until 2027.[145] Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea and China, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.[146][147]

        Law enforcement

        The headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department
        Domestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency.[148] As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission.[149] The Special Assault Team comprises national-level counter-terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads.[150] The Japan Coast Guard guards territorial waters surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration.[151]

        The Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law strictly regulates the civilian ownership of guns, swords, and other weaponry.[152][153] According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, among the member states of the UN that report statistics as of 2018, the incidence rates of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, sexual violence, and robbery are very low in Japan.[154][155][156][157]

        Human rights
        Main article: Human rights in Japan
        Japanese society traditionally places a strong emphasis on collective harmony and conformity, which has led to the suppression of individual rights.[158] Japan's constitution prohibits racial and religious discrimination,[159][160] and the country is a signatory to numerous international human rights treaties.[161] However, it lacks any laws against discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity and does not have a national human rights institution.[162]

        Japan has faced criticism for its gender inequality,[163] not allowing same-sex marriages,[164] use of racial profiling by police,[165][166] and allowing capital punishment.[167] Other human rights issues include the treatment of marginalized groups, such as ethnic minorities,[168] refugees and asylum seekers.[169]

        Economy
        Main article: Economy of Japan

        Japan has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP, after that of the United States, China, Germany and India; and the fifth-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP.[170] As of 2023, Japan's labor force is the world's tenth-largest, consisting of over 69.2 million workers.[85] As of 2024, Japan has a low unemployment rate of around 2.6%.[171] Its poverty rate is the second highest among the G7 countries,[172] and exceeds 15.7% of the population.[173] Japan has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP among advanced economies,[174] with a national debt estimated at 248% relative to GDP as of 2022.[175] The Japanese yen is the world's third-largest reserve currency after the US dollar and the euro.[176]

        In 2024, Japan was the world's eight-largest exporter[177] and sixth-largest importer.[178] Its exports amounted to 21.9% of its total GDP in 2023.[179] In 2024, Japan's main export markets were China (22.2%, including Hong Kong) and the United States (20.6%).[180] Its main exports are motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors, and auto parts.[85] Japan's main import markets in 2024 were China (22.3%), the United States (10.5%), and Australia (7.1%).[180] Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs, chemicals, and raw materials.[180]

        The Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are common in the Japanese work environment.[181][182] Japan has a large cooperative sector, with three of the world's ten largest cooperatives, including the largest consumer cooperative and the largest agricultural cooperative as of 2018.[183] It ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. The country attracted 36.9 million international tourists in 2024,[184] and was ranked eleventh in the world in 2019 for inbound tourism.[185] The 2024 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report ranked Japan third in the world out of 117 countries.[186] Its international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to $46.1 billion.[185]

        The Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.2% of the country's total GDP as of 2018.[117] Only 11.2% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation.[187] Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas.[188] This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% as of 2018.[189] Japan's small agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected.[190] There has been a growing concern about farming as farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.[191]

        Japan ranked seventh in the world in tonnage of fish caught and captured 3,167,610 metric tons of fish in 2016, down from an annual average of 4,000,000 tons over the previous decade.[192] Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch,[85] prompting critiques that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna.[193] Japan has sparked controversy by supporting commercial whaling.[194]

        Japan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the "largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods".[85] Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP.[85] The country's manufacturing output is the fourth highest in the world as of 2023.[196]

        Japan is in the top three globally for both automobile production[195] and export,[197][198] and is home to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company by production. The Japanese shipbuilding industry faces increasing competition from its East Asian neighbors, South Korea and China; a 2020 government initiative identified this sector as a target for increasing exports.[199]

        Once considered the strongest in the world, the Japanese consumer electronics industry is in a state of decline as regional competition arises in neighboring East Asian countries such as South Korea and China.[200] However, Japan's video game sector remains a major industry; in 2014, Japan's consumer video game market grossed $9.6 billion, with $5.8 billion coming from mobile gaming.[201] By 2015, Japan had become the world's fourth-largest PC game market by revenue, behind China, the United States, and South Korea.[202]

        Japan's service sector accounts for about 69.8% of its total economic output as of 2023.[203] Banking, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries, with companies such as Toyota, Mitsubishi UFJ, -NTT, Aeon, SoftBank, Hitachi, and Itochu listed as among the largest in the world.[204][205]

        Relative to gross domestic product, Japan's research and development budget is the sixth or seventh highest in the world,[206] with 907,400 researchers sharing a 22-trillion-yen research and development budget as of 2023.[207] Japan has the second highest number of researchers in science and technology per capita in the world with 14 per 1000 employees.[208] The country has produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine,[209] and three Fields medalists.[210]

        Japan leads the world in robotics production and use, supplying 38% of the world's 2024 total;[211] down from 55% in 2017.[212]

        The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is Japan's national space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites.[213] It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kibō) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008.[214] The space probe Akatsuki was launched in 2010 and achieved orbit around Venus in 2015.[215] Japan's plans in space exploration include building a Moon base and landing astronauts by 2030.[216] In 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) from Tanegashima Space Center. The largest lunar mission since the Apollo program, its purpose was to gather data on the Moon's origin and evolution. The explorer entered a lunar orbit on October 4, 2007,[217][218] and was deliberately crashed into the Moon on June 11, 2009.[219]

        Japan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure since the 1990s.[220] The country has approximately 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,000,000 kilometers (620,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 130,000 kilometers (81,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 54,736 kilometers (34,011 miles) of general national highways and 7641 kilometers (4748 miles) of national expressways as of 2017.[221]

        Since privatization in 1987,[222] dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. The high-speed Shinkansen (bullet trains) that connect major cities are known for their safety and punctuality.[223]

        There are 280 airports in Japan as of 2025.[85] The largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport in Tokyo, was Asia's second-busiest airport in 2019.[224] The Keihin and Hanshin superport hubs are among the largest in the world, at 7.98 and 5.22 million TEU respectively as of 2017.[225]

        Energy
        Main article: Energy in Japan

        As of 2019, 37.1% of energy in Japan is produced from petroleum, 25.1% from coal, 22.4% from natural gas, 3.5% from hydropower and 2.8% from nuclear power, among other sources. Nuclear power was down from 11.2% in 2010.[226] By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service.[227] The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015,[228] and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted.[229] Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and has a heavy dependence on imported energy.[230] The country has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.[231]

        View of Tokyo from the top of the Tokyo Skytree. The Greater Tokyo Area is ranked as the most populous metropolitan area in the world.
        Japan has a population of almost 123 million, of whom nearly 120 million are Japanese nationals (2024 estimates).[232] A small population of foreign residents makes up the remainder.[233] Japan is the world's fastest aging country and has the highest proportion of elderly citizens of any country, comprising one-third of its total population;[234] this is the result of a post–World War II baby boom, which was followed by an increase in life expectancy and a decrease in birth rates.[235]

        Japan has a total fertility rate of 1.2, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1, and is among the world's lowest:[236] it has a median age of 48.4, the highest in the world.[237] As of 2025, over 29.3% of the population is over 65, or more than one in four out of the Japanese population.[232] As a growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remaining childless,[238][239] Japan's population is expected to drop to around 88 million by 2065.[234]

        The changes in demographic structure have created several social issues, particularly a decline in the workforce population and an increase in the cost of social security benefits.[238] The Government of Japan projects that there will be almost one elderly person for each person of working age by 2060.[237] Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population.[240][241] On April 1, 2019, Japan's revised immigration law was enacted, protecting the rights of foreign workers to help reduce labor shortages in certain sectors.[242]

        In 2023, 92% of the Japanese population lived in cities.[243] The capital city, Tokyo, has a population of 13.9 million (2022).[244] It is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the biggest metropolitan area in the world with 37.4 million people (2024).[245] Japan is an ethnically and culturally homogeneous society,[246] with the Japanese people forming 97.4% of the country's population.[247] Minority ethnic groups in the country include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan people.[248] Zainichi Koreans,[249] Chinese,[250] Filipinos,[251] Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent,[252] and Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent are also among Japan's small minority groups.[253] Burakumin make up a social minority group.[254]

        Languages
        Main article: Languages of Japan

        Kanji and hiragana signs
        The Japanese language is Japan's de facto national language and the primary written and spoken language of most people in the country.[255] Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radicals used by kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.[256] English has taken a major role in Japan as a business and international link language, and is a compulsory subject at the junior and senior high school levels.[257] Japanese Sign Language is the primary sign language used in Japan and has gained some official recognition, but its usage has been historically hindered by discriminatory policies and a lack of educational support.[255]

        Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain.[258] Few children learn these languages,[259] but local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages.[260] The Ainu language, which is a language isolate, is moribund, with only a few native speakers remaining as of 2014.[261] Additionally, a number of other languages are taught and used by ethnic minorities, immigrant communities, and a growing number of foreign-language students, such as Korean (including a distinct Zainichi Korean dialect), Chinese and Portuguese.[255]

        Religion
        Main article: Religion in Japan

        The torii of Itsukushima Shinto Shrine near Hiroshima
        Japan's constitution guarantees full religious freedom.[262] Upper estimates suggest that 84–96% of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion.[263] However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual.[264] The level of participation in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year.[265] Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.[32]

        In 2018, 1%[266] to 1.5% of the population were Christians.[267] Throughout the latest century, Western customs originally related to Christianity, including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas, have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.[268]

        About 90% of those practicing Islam in Japan are foreign-born migrants as of 2016.[269] In 2018, there were an estimated 105 mosques and 200,000 Muslims in Japan, 43,000 of which were Japanese nationals.[270] Other minority religions include Hinduism, Judaism, and Baháʼí Faith, as well as the animist beliefs of the Ainu.[271]

        Education
        Main article: Education in Japan

        Since the 1947 Fundamental Law of Education, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years.[272] Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school.[273] The top-ranking university in Japan is the University of Tokyo.[274] Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program. MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide.[275]

        The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) coordinated by the OECD ranks the knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as the third best in the world.[276] Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, math, and sciences with the average student scoring 520 and has one of the world's highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries.[277][276][278] It spent 7.4% of its total GDP on education in 2021.[279]

        In 2023, Japan ranked third for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education, at 56%.[280] Approximately 65.5% of Japanese aged 25 to 34 have some form of tertiary education qualification, with bachelor's degrees being held by 34.8% of Japanese aged 25 to 64, the second most in the OECD after South Korea.[280] Japanese women are more highly educated than the men: 59% of women possess a university degree, compared to 52% of men.[281]

        Main articles: Health in Japan and Health care system in Japan

        University of Tokyo Hospital
        Health care in Japan is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments.[282] Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.[283]

        Japan spent 11.42% of its total GDP on healthcare in 2022.[284] In 2020, the overall life expectancy in Japan at birth was 85 years (82 years for men and 88 years for women),[285][286] the highest in the world;[287] while it had a very low infant mortality rate (2 per 1,000 live births).[288] Since 1981, the principal cause of death in Japan is cancer, which accounted for 27% of the total deaths in 2018—followed by cardiovascular diseases, which led to 15% of the deaths.[289] Japan has one of the world's highest suicide rates, which is considered a major social issue.[290] Another significant public health issue is smoking among Japanese men.[291] Japan has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia among developed countries.[292]

        Culture

        Contemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe, and North America.[293] Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords, and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha, and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures.[294] Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance.[295] Japan is considered a cultural superpower.[296][297][298][299]

        Ritsurin Garden, one of the most famous strolling gardens in Japan
        The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas.[300] The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.[300]

        Japanese architecture is a combination of local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden or mud plaster structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs.[301] Traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.[302] Since the 19th century, Japan has incorporated much of Western modern architecture into construction and design.[303] It was not until after World War II that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzō Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.[304]

        Literature and philosophy
        Main articles: Japanese literature and Japanese philosophy

        12th-century illustrated handscroll of The Tale of Genji, a National Treasure
        The earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'yōshū poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters.[305][306] In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (hiragana and katakana) was developed.[307] The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest extant Japanese narrative.[308] An account of court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.[309][310]

        During the Edo period, the chōnin ("townspeople") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bashō revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinshū with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue Oku no Hosomichi.[311] The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume Sōseki and Mori Ōgai were significant novelists in the early 20th century, followed by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, Kafū Nagai and, more recently, Haruki Murakami and Kenji Nakagami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors – Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzaburō Ōe (1994).[312]

        Japanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals remain evident in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society.[313] Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.[314]

        Japanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century.[315] Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, forms an integral part of Japanese culture.[316] Kumi-daiko (ensemble drumming) was developed in post-war Japan and became very popular in North America.[317] Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop.[318] Karaoke is a significant cultural activity.[319]

        The four traditional theaters from Japan are noh, kyōgen, kabuki, and bunraku.[320] Noh is one of the oldest continuous theater traditions in the world.[321]

        The Japanese media franchise Pokemon is the highest grossing media franchise of all time
        According to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 79% of Japanese watch television daily.[322] Japanese television dramas are viewed both within Japan and internationally.[323] Many Japanese media franchises have gained considerable global popularity and are among the world's highest-grossing media franchises. Japanese newspapers are among the most circulated in the world as of 2016.[324]

        Japan has one of the oldest and largest film industries globally.[325] Ishirō Honda's Godzilla became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of kaiju films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history.[326][327] Japanese comics, known as manga, developed in the mid-20th century and have become popular worldwide.[328][329] A large number of manga series have become some of the best-selling comics series of all time, rivalling the American comics industry.[330] Japanese animated films and television series, known as anime, were largely influenced by Japanese manga and have become highly popular globally.[331][332]

        Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients.[336] Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staples.[337] Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be termed a national dish, alongside ramen and sushi.[338][339] Traditional Japanese sweets are known as wagashi.[340] Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes include green tea ice cream.[341]

        Popular Japanese beverages include sake, a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 14–17% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice.[342] Beer has been brewed in Japan since the late 17th century.[343] Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in forms such as matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.[344]

        <p>France,[h] officially the French Republic,[i] is a country primarily located in Western Europe. Its overseas regions and territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean, giving it the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zone in the world. Metropolitan France shares borders with Belgium and Luxembourg to the north; Germany to the northeast; Switzerland to the east; Italy and Monaco to the southeast; Andorra and Spain to the south; and a maritime border with the United Kingdom to the northwest. Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea. Its 18 integral regions—five of which are overseas—span a combined area of 632,702 km2 (244,288 sq mi) and have an estimated total population of over 68.6 million as of January 2025. France is a semi-presidential republic. Its capital, largest city and main cultural and economic centre is Paris.

        Metropolitan France was settled during the Iron Age by Celtic tribes known as Gauls before Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture. In the Early Middle Ages, the Franks formed the kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia evolving into the Kingdom of France. In the High Middle Ages, France was a powerful but decentralised feudal kingdom, but from the mid-14th to the mid-15th centuries, France was plunged into a dynastic conflict with England known as the Hundred Years' War. In the 16th century French culture flourished during the French Renaissance, and a French colonial empire emerged. Internally, France was dominated by the conflict with the House of Habsburg and the French Wars of Religion between Catholics and Huguenots. France was successful in the Thirty Years' War and further increased its influence during the reign of Louis XIV.

        The French Revolution of 1789 overthrew the Ancien Régime and produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating part of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. Its collapse initiated a period of relative decline in which France endured the Bourbon Restoration until the founding of the French Second Republic which was succeeded by the Second French Empire upon Napoleon III's takeover. His empire collapsed during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. This led to the establishment of the French Third Republic, with a period of economic prosperity and cultural and scientific flourishing known as the Belle Époque. France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious at great human and economic cost. It was among the Allies of World War II, but it surrendered and was occupied in 1940. Following its liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the defeat in the Algerian War. The current Fifth Republic was formed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle. Algeria and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with France.

        France retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science, and philosophy. It hosts the fourth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the world's leading tourist destination, having received 100 million foreign visitors in 2023. A developed country, France has a high nominal per capita income globally, and its economy ranks among the largest in the world by both nominal GDP and PPP-adjusted GDP. It is a great power, being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state. The country is part of multiple international organisations and forums.

        Etymology
        Main article: Name of France
        Originally applied to the whole Frankish Empire, the name France comes from the Latin Francia, or 'realm of the Franks'.[11] The name of the Franks is related to the English word frank ('free'): the latter stems from the Old French franc ('free, noble, sincere'), and ultimately from the Medieval Latin word francus ('free, exempt from service; a freeman, a Frank'), a generalisation of the tribal name that emerged as a Late Latin borrowing of the reconstructed Frankish endonym *Frank.[12][13] It has been suggested that the meaning 'free' was adopted because after the conquest of Gaul, only Franks were free of taxation,[14] or more generally because they had the status of freemen in contrast to servants or slaves.[13] The etymology of *Frank is uncertain. It is traditionally derived from the Proto-Germanic word *frankōn, which translates as 'javelin' or 'lance' (the throwing axe of the Franks was known as the francisca),[15] although these weapons may have been named because of their use by the Franks, not the other way around.[13]

        In English, 'France' is pronounced /fræns/ FRANSS in American English and /frɑːns/ FRAHNSS or /fræns/ FRANSS in British English. The pronunciation with /ɑː/ is mostly confined to accents with the trap–bath split such as Received Pronunciation, though it can be also heard in some other dialects such as Cardiff English.[16]

        Prehistory
        Main article: Prehistory of France
        The oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now France date from approximately 1.8 million years ago.[17] Neanderthals occupied the region into the Upper Paleolithic era but were slowly replaced by Homo sapiens around 35,000 BC.[18] This period witnessed the emergence of cave painting in the Dordogne and Pyrenees, including at Lascaux, dated to c. 18,000 BC.[17] At the end of the Last Glacial Period (10,000 BC), the climate became milder;[17] from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of Western Europe entered the Neolithic era, and its inhabitants became sedentary.

        After demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia BC, metallurgy appeared, initially working gold, copper and bronze, then later iron.[19] France has numerous megalithic sites from the Neolithic, including the Carnac stones site (approximately 3,300 BC).

        Antiquity (6th century BC – 5th century AD)
        In 600 BC, Ionian Greeks from Phocaea founded the colony of Massalia (present-day Marseille).[20] Celtic tribes penetrated parts of eastern and northern France, spreading through the rest of the country between the 5th and 3rd century BC.[21] Around 390 BC, the Gallic chieftain Brennus and his troops made their way to Roman Italy, defeated the Romans in the Battle of the Allia, and besieged and ransomed Rome.[22] This left Rome weakened, and the Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC when they entered into a peace treaty.[23] But the Romans and the Gauls remained adversaries for centuries.[24]

        Maison Carrée temple in Nemausus Corinthian columns and portico
        The Maison carrée was a temple of the Gallo-Roman city of Nemausus (present-day Nîmes) and is one of the best-preserved Roman temples anywhere.
        Around 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region Provincia Nostra ("Our Province"), which evolved into Provence in French.[25] Julius Caesar conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt by Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix in 52 BC.[26] Gaul was divided by Augustus into provinces,[27] and many cities were founded during the Gallo-Roman period, including Lugdunum (present-day Lyon), the capital of the Gauls.[27] In 250–290 AD, Roman Gaul suffered a crisis with its fortified borders attacked by barbarians.[28] The situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, a period of revival and prosperity.[29] In 312, Emperor Constantine I converted to Christianity. Christians, who had been persecuted, increased.[30] But from the 5th century, the barbarian invasions resumed.[31] Teutonic tribes invaded the region, the Visigoths settling in the southwest, the Burgundians along the Rhine Valley, and the Franks in the north.[32]

        Early Middle Ages (5th–10th century)
        In late antiquity, Gaul was divided into Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory. Celtic Britons, fleeing the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, settled in west Armorica; the Armorican peninsula was renamed Brittany, and Celtic culture was revived.

        The first leader to unite all Franks was Clovis I, who began his reign as king of the Salian Franks in 481, routing the last forces of the Roman governors in 486. Clovis said he would be baptised a Christian in the event of victory against the Visigothic Kingdom, which was said to have guaranteed the battle. Clovis regained the southwest from the Visigoths and was baptised in 508. Clovis was the first Germanic conqueror after the Fall of the Western Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity; thus France was given the title "Eldest daughter of the Church" by the papacy,[33] and French kings were called "the Most Christian Kings of France".

        painting of Clovis I conversion to Catholicism in 498, a king being baptised in a tub in a cathedral surrounded by bishop and monks
        With Clovis's conversion to Catholicism in 498, the Frankish monarchy, elective and secular until then, became hereditary and of divine right.
        The Franks embraced the Christian Gallo-Roman culture, and Gaul was renamed Francia ("Land of the Franks"). The Germanic Franks adopted Romanic languages. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian dynasty, but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from that of Clovis: Paris, Orléans, Soissons, and Rheims. The last Merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace (head of household). One mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated an Umayyad invasion at the Battle of Tours in 732.[34] His son, Pepin the Short, seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the Carolingian dynasty. Pepin's son Charlemagne reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built an empire across Western and Central Europe.

        Proclaimed Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III and thus establishing the French government's longtime historical association with the Catholic Church,[35] Charlemagne tried to revive the Western Roman Empire and its cultural grandeur. Charlemagne's son Louis I kept the empire united, however in 843 it was divided between Louis' three sons into East Francia, Middle Francia and West Francia. West Francia approximated the area occupied by modern France and was its precursor.[36]

        During the 9th and 10th centuries, threatened by Viking invasions, France became a decentralised state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and so was less effective and challenged by noblemen. Thus was established feudalism in France. Some king's vassals grew so powerful they posed a threat to the king. After the Battle of Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror added "King of England" to his titles, becoming vassal and the equal of the king of France, creating recurring tensions.

        High and Late Middle Ages (10th–15th century)
        See also: France in the Middle Ages

        Joan of Arc led the French Army to several important victories during the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453), which paved the way for the final victory.
        The Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when Hugh Capet was crowned king of the Franks.[37] His descendants unified the country through wars and inheritance. From 1190, the Capetian rulers began to be referred as "kings of France" rather than "kings of the Franks".[38] Later kings expanded their directly possessed domaine royal to cover over half of modern France by the 15th century. Royal authority became more assertive, centred on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility, clergy, and commoners.

        The nobility played a prominent role in Crusades to restore Christian access to the Holy Land. French knights made up most reinforcements in the 200 years of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs referred to crusaders as Franj.[39] French Crusaders imported French into the Levant, making Old French the base of the lingua franca ("Frankish language") of the Crusader states.[39] The Albigensian Crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical Cathars in the southwest of modern-day France.[40]

        From the 11th century, the House of Plantagenet, rulers of the County of Anjou, established its dominion over the surrounding provinces of Maine and Touraine, then built an "empire" from England to the Pyrenees, covering half of modern France. Tensions between France and the Plantagenet empire would last a hundred years, until Philip II of France conquered, between 1202 and 1214, most continental possessions of the empire, leaving England and Aquitaine to the Plantagenets.

        Charles IV the Fair died without an heir in 1328.[41] The crown passed to Philip of Valois rather than Edward of Plantagenet, who became Edward III of England. During the reign of Philip, the monarchy reached the height of its medieval power.[41] However Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward in 1337, and England and France entered the off-and-on Hundred Years' War.[42] Boundaries changed, but landholdings inside France by English kings remained extensive for decades. With charismatic leaders such as Joan of Arc, French counterattacks won back most English continental territories. France was struck by the Black Death, from which half of the 17 million population died.[43]

        Early modern period (15th century–1789)
        Main article: France in the early modern period
        The French Renaissance saw cultural development and standardisation of French, which became the official language of France and Europe's aristocracy. France became rivals of the House of Habsburg during the Italian Wars, which would dictate much of their later foreign policy until the mid-18th century. French explorers claimed lands in the Americas, paving expansion of the French colonial empire. The rise of Protestantism led France to a civil war known as the French Wars of Religion.[44] This forced Huguenots to flee to Protestant regions such as the British Isles and Switzerland. The wars were ended by Henry IV's Edict of Nantes, which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots. Spanish troops[45] assisted the Catholics from 1589 to 1594 and invaded France in 1597. Spain and France returned to all-out war between 1635 and 1659. The Franco-Spanish War cost France 300,000 casualties.[46]

        Under Louis XIII, Cardinal Richelieu promoted centralisation of the state and reinforced royal power. He destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private armies. By the end of the 1620s, Richelieu established "the royal monopoly of force".[47] France fought in the Thirty Years' War, supporting the Protestant side against the Habsburgs. From the 16th to the 19th century, France was responsible for about 10% of the transatlantic slave trade.[48]

        Louis XIV of France standing in plate armour and blue sash facing left holding baton
        Louis XIV, the "Sun King", was the absolute monarch of France who made the country the leading power in Europe.
        During Louis XIV's minority, trouble known as The Fronde occurred. This rebellion was driven by feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the royal absolute power. The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and reign of Louis XIV, during which France further increased its influence.[49] By turning lords into courtiers at the Palace of Versailles, his command of the military went unchallenged. The "Sun King" made France the leading European power. France became the most populous European country and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, and literature until the 20th century.[50] France took control of territories in the Americas, Africa and Asia. In 1685, Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes, forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile and published the Code Noir providing the legal framework for slavery and expelling Jews from French colonies.[51]

        Under the wars of Louis XV, France lost New France and most Indian possessions after its defeat in the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). Its European territory kept growing, however, with acquisitions such as Lorraine and Corsica. Louis XV's weak rule, including the decadence of his court, discredited the monarchy, which in part paved the way for the French Revolution.[52]

        Louis XVI supported America with money, fleets and armies, helping them win independence from Great Britain. France gained revenge but verged on bankruptcy—a factor that contributed to the Revolution. Some of the Enlightenment occurred in French intellectual circles, and scientific breakthroughs, such as the naming of oxygen and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers, were achieved by French scientists. French explorers took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions. Enlightenment philosophy, in which reason is advocated as the primary source of legitimacy, undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and was a factor in the Revolution.

        Revolutionary France (1789–1799)
        drawing of the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, smoke of gunfire enveloping stone castle
        The Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 was the most emblematic event of the French Revolution.
        The French Revolution was a period of political and societal change that began with the Estates General of 1789, and ended with the coup of 18 Brumaire in 1799 and the formation of the French Consulate. Many of its ideas are fundamental principles of liberal democracy,[53] while its values and institutions remain central to modern political discourse.[54]

        Its causes were a combination of social, political and economic factors, which the Ancien Régime proved unable to manage. A financial crisis and social distress led in May 1789 to the convocation of the Estates General, which was converted into a National Assembly in June. The Storming of the Bastille on 14 July led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, among them the abolition of feudalism, state control over the Catholic Church in France, and a declaration of rights.[55]

        The next three years were dominated by struggle for political control, exacerbated by economic depression. Military defeats following the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in April 1792 resulted in the insurrection of 10 August 1792. The monarchy was abolished and replaced by the French First Republic in September, while Louis XVI was executed in January 1793.[56]

        After another revolt in June 1793, the constitution was suspended and power passed from the National Convention to the Committee of Public Safety. About 16,000 people were executed in a Reign of Terror, which ended in July 1794. Weakened by external threats and internal opposition, the Republic was replaced in 1795 by the Directory. Four years later in 1799, the Consulate seized power in a coup led by Napoleon.[57]

        Napoleon, Emperor of the French, built a vast empire across Europe.[58]
        Napoleon became First Consul in 1799 and later Emperor of the French Empire. Changing sets of European coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's empire. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the battles of Jena-Auerstadt and Austerlitz. Members of the Bonaparte family were appointed monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.[59]

        These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the metric system, Napoleonic Code and Declaration of the Rights of Man. In 1812 Napoleon attacked Russia, reaching Moscow. Thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease, Russian attacks, and finally winter. After this catastrophic campaign and the ensuing uprising of European monarchies against his rule, Napoleon was defeated. About a million Frenchmen died during the Napoleonic Wars.[59] After his brief return from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, and the Bourbon monarchy was restored with new constitutional limitations.

        Colonial empire
        The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the July Revolution of 1830, which established the constitutional July Monarchy; French troops began the conquest of Algeria. Unrest led to the French Revolution of 1848 and the end of the July Monarchy. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of male universal suffrage was re-enacted in 1848. In 1852, president of the French Republic, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the Second Empire, as Napoleon III. He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially in Crimea, Mexico and Italy. Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, and his regime was replaced by the Third Republic. By 1875, the French conquest of Algeria was complete, with approximately 825,000 Algerians killed from famine, disease, and violence.[60]


        French colonial empires:
        First
        Second
        France had colonial possessions since the beginning of the 17th century, but in the 19th and 20th centuries its empire extended greatly and became the second-largest behind the British Empire.[61] Including metropolitan France, the total area reached almost 13 million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s, 9% of the world's land. Known as the Belle Époque, the turn of the century was characterised by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. In 1905, state secularism was officially established.

        France was invaded by Germany and defended by Great Britain at the start of World War I in August 1914. A rich industrial area in the north was occupied. France and the Allies emerged victorious against the Central Powers at tremendous human cost. It left 1.4 million French soldiers dead, 4% of its population.[62][63] Interwar was marked by intense international tensions and social reforms introduced by the Popular Front government (e.g., annual leave, eight-hour workdays, women in government).

        In 1940, France was invaded and quickly defeated by Nazi Germany. France was divided into a German occupation zone in the north, an Italian occupation zone and an unoccupied territory, the rest of France, which consisted of southern France and the French empire. The Vichy government, an authoritarian regime collaborating with Germany, ruled the unoccupied territory. Free France, the government-in-exile led by Charles de Gaulle, was set up in London.[64]

        From 1942 to 1944, about 160,000 French citizens, including around 75,000 Jews,[65] were deported to death and concentration camps.[66] On 6 June 1944, the Allies invaded Normandy, and in August they invaded Provence. The Allies and French Resistance emerged victorious, and French sovereignty was restored with the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF). This interim government, established by de Gaulle, continued to wage war against Germany and to purge collaborators from office. It made important reforms e.g. suffrage extended to women and the creation of a social security system.

        A new constitution resulted in the Fourth Republic (1946–1958), which saw strong economic growth (les Trente Glorieuses). France was a founding member of NATO and attempted to regain control of French Indochina, but was defeated by the Viet Minh in 1954. France faced another anti-colonialist conflict in Algeria, then part of France and home to over one million European settlers (Pied-Noir). The French systematically used torture and repression, including extrajudicial killings to keep control.[67] This conflict nearly led to a coup and civil war.[68]

        During the May 1958 crisis, the weak Fourth Republic gave way to the Fifth Republic, which included a strengthened presidency.[69] The war concluded with the Évian Accords in 1962 which led to Algerian independence, at a high price: between half a million and one million deaths and over 2 million internally-displaced Algerians.[70] Around one million Pied-Noirs and Harkis fled from Algeria to France.[71] A vestige of the empire is the French overseas departments and territories.

        During the Cold War, de Gaulle pursued a policy of "national independence" towards the Western and Eastern blocs. He withdrew from NATO's military-integrated command (while remaining within the alliance), launched a nuclear development programme and made France the fourth nuclear power. He restored cordial Franco-German relations to create a European counterweight between American and Soviet spheres of influence. However, he opposed any development of a supranational Europe, favouring sovereign nations. The revolt of May 1968 had an enormous social impact; it was a watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted to a more liberal moral ideal (secularism, individualism, sexual revolution). Although the revolt was a political failure (the Gaullist party emerged stronger than before) it announced a split between the French and de Gaulle, who resigned.[72]

        In the post-Gaullist era, France remained one of the most developed economies in the world but faced crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, France has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational European Union, notably by signing the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, establishing the eurozone in 1999[73] and signing the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007.[74] France has fully reintegrated into NATO and since participated in most NATO-sponsored wars.[75] Since the 19th century, France has received many immigrants, often male foreign workers from European Catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed.[76] During the 1970s France faced an economic crisis and allowed new immigrants (mostly from the Maghreb, in northwest Africa)[76] to permanently settle in France with their families and acquire citizenship. It resulted in hundreds of thousands of Muslims living in subsidised public housing and suffering from high unemployment rates.[77] The government had a policy of assimilation of immigrants, where they were expected to adhere to French values and norms.[78]

        Since the 1995 public transport bombings, France has been targeted by Islamist organisations, notably the Charlie Hebdo attack in 2015 which provoked the largest public rallies in French history, gathering 4.4 million people,[79] the November 2015 Paris attacks which resulted in 130 deaths, the deadliest attack on French soil since World War II[80] and the deadliest in the European Union since the Madrid train bombings in 2004.[81] Opération Chammal, France's military efforts to contain ISIS, killed over 1,000 ISIS troops between 2014 and 2015.[82]

        Geography
        Main article: Geography of France

        Chamonix valley with the Mont Blanc at background, the highest mountain in the Alps and Western Europe on the border with Italy
        The vast majority of France's territory and population is situated in Western Europe and is called Metropolitan France. It is bordered by the North Sea in the north, the English Channel in the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean Sea in the southeast. Its land borders consist of Belgium and Luxembourg in the northeast, Germany and Switzerland in the east, Italy and Monaco in the southeast, and Andorra and Spain in the south and southwest. Except for the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south, the Pyrenees and the Alps; to the southeast, Jura Mountains; and to the east, the Rhine river. Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is Corsica. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes 41° and 51° N, and longitudes 6° W and 10° E, on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern temperate zone. Its continental part covers about 1000 km from north to south and from east to west.

        Metropolitan France covers 551,500 square kilometres (212,935 sq mi),[83] the largest among European Union members.[73] France's total land area, with its overseas departments and territories (excluding Adélie Land), is 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi),[84] 0.45% of the total land area on Earth. France possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to the mountain ranges of the Alps in the southeast, the Massif Central in the south-central and Pyrenees in the southwest. With numerous overseas departments and territories scattered across the planet, France possesses the second-largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the world, covering 11,035,000 km2 (4,261,000 sq mi). Its EEZ covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world.

        Geology, topography and hydrography

        Geological formations near Roussillon, Vaucluse
        Metropolitan France has a wide variety of topographic sets and natural landscapes. During the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, the Armorican Massif, the Massif Central, the Morvan, the Vosges and Ardennes ranges and the island of Corsica were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine Basin in the southwest and the Paris Basin in the north. Various routes of natural passage, such as the Rhône Valley, allow easy communication. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura Mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. At 4,810.45 metres (15,782 ft)[85] above sea level, Mont Blanc in the Alps is the highest point in Western Europe. 60% of municipalities are classified as having moderate seismic risk.

        The coastlines offer contrasting landscapes: mountain ranges along the French Riviera, coastal cliffs such as the Côte d'Albâtre, and wide sandy plains in the Languedoc. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast. France has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers: the Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, the Rhône and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory. The Rhône divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Camargue. The Garonne meets the Dordogne just after Bordeaux, forming the Gironde estuary, the largest estuary in Western Europe which after approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) empties into the Atlantic Ocean.[86] Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the northeastern borders. France has 11,000,000 km2 (4,200,000 sq mi) of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97% are overseas.

        Environment
        See also: List of national parks of France, Regional natural parks of France, and Climate change in France
        On June 28, 2019, in Vérargues, the temperature reached 46 °C, setting a temperature record in Metropolitan France since records began.[87] Climate change means that this kind of heatwave in France can be expected to occur 10 times more frequently than it would have done a century ago.[88][89] France was one of the first countries to create an environment ministry, in 1971.[90] France is ranked 19th by carbon dioxide emissions due to the country's heavy investment in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis,[91] which now accounts for 75 per cent of its electricity production[92] and results in less pollution.[93][94] According to the 2020 Environmental Performance Index conducted by Yale and Columbia, France was the fifth most environmentally conscious country in the world.[95][96] Like all European Union state members, France agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20% of 1990 levels by 2020.[97] As of 2009, carbon dioxide emissions per capita are lower than that of China.[98] The country was set to impose a carbon tax in 2009;[99] however, the plan was abandoned due to fears of it burdening French businesses.[100]


        The Gironde estuary is classified as a marine nature park and is part of the Natura 2000 network. The left bank is part of the Médoc regional nature park. With a surface area of 635 km2 (245 sq mi), it is the largest estuary in Europe.
        Forests account for 31 per cent of the land area—the fourth-highest proportion in Europe—representing an increase of 7 per cent since 1990.[101][102][103] The forests are some of the most diverse in Europe, comprising more than 140 species of trees.[104] France had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.52/10, ranking it 123rd globally.[105] There are nine national parks[106] and 46 natural parks.[107] A regional nature park[108] (French: parc naturel régional or PNR) is a public establishment in France between local authorities and the national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty, to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development in the area.[109][110] As of 2019 there are 54 PNRs in France.[111]

        Politics
        Main article: Politics of France
        France is a representative democracy organised as a unitary semi-presidential republic.[112] Democratic traditions and values are deeply rooted in French culture, identity and politics.[113] The Constitution of the Fifth Republic was approved by referendum in 1958, establishing a framework consisting of executive, legislative and judicial branches.[114] It sought to address the instability of the Third and Fourth Republics by combining elements of both the parliamentary and presidential systems, while greatly strengthening the authority of the executive relative to the legislature.[113]

        Prime Minister
        since 2025
        The executive branch has two leaders. The president, who is Emmanuel Macron since 2017, is the head of state, elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a five-year term.[115] The prime minister, who is Sébastien Lecornu since 2025, is the head of government, appointed by the president to lead the government. The president has the power to dissolve parliament or circumvent it by submitting referendums directly to the people; the president also appoints judges and civil servants, negotiates and ratifies international agreements, and serves as commander-in-chief of the French Armed Forces. The prime minister determines public policy and oversees the civil service, with an emphasis on domestic matters.[116] In the 2022 presidential election, Macron was re-elected.[117] Two months later in the legislative elections, Macron lost his parliamentary majority and had to form a minority government.[118]


        Palais Bourbon is the meeting place of the National Assembly, the lower legislative chamber of the French Parliament.
        The legislature consists of the French Parliament, a bicameral body made up of a lower house, the National Assembly and an upper house, the Senate.[119] Legislators in the National Assembly, known as députés, represent local constituencies and are directly elected for five-year terms.[120] The Assembly has the power to dismiss the government by majority vote. Senators are chosen by an electoral college for six-year terms, with half the seats submitted to election every three years.[121] The Senate's legislative powers are limited; in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say.[122] The parliament is responsible for determining the rules and principles concerning most areas of law, political amnesty, and fiscal policy; however, the government may draft specific details concerning most laws.

        From World War II until 2017, French politics was dominated by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, the French Section of the Workers' International, which was succeeded by the Socialist Party in 1969; and the other right-wing, the Gaullist Party, whose name changed over time to the Rally of the French People (1947), the Union of Democrats for the Republic (1958), the Rally for the Republic (1976), the Union for a Popular Movement (2007) and The Republicans (since 2015). In the 2017 presidential and legislative elections, the radical centrist party La République En Marche! (LREM) became the dominant force, overtaking both Socialists and Republicans. LREM's opponent in the second round of the 2017 and 2022 presidential elections was the growing far-right party National Rally (RN). Since 2020, The Ecologists have performed well in mayoral elections in major cities[123] while on a national level, the New Ecological and Social People's Union was the second-largest voting block elected to the lower house in 2022.[124] Right-wing populist RN became the largest opposition party in the National Assembly in 2022.[125]

        The electorate is constitutionally empowered to vote on amendments passed by the Parliament and bills submitted by the president. Referendums have played a key role in shaping French politics and even foreign policy; voters have decided on such matters as Algeria's independence, the election of the president by popular vote, the formation of the EU, and the reduction of presidential term limits.[126]

        Administrative divisions
        Main article: Administrative divisions of France
        France is divided into 18 regions (located in Europe and overseas), five overseas collectivities, one overseas territory, one special collectivity (New Caledonia) and one uninhabited island (Clipperton) under the authority of the Minister of Overseas France.

        Since 2016, France is divided into 18 administrative regions: 13 regions in metropolitan France (including Corsica),[127] and five overseas.[83] The regions are further subdivided into 101 departments,[128] which are numbered mainly alphabetically. The department number is used in postal codes and was formerly used on vehicle registration plates. Among the 101 French departments, five (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Réunion) are in overseas regions that are simultaneously overseas departments, enjoying the same status as metropolitan departments and are thereby included in the European Union.

        The 101 departments are subdivided into 335 arrondissements, which are, in turn, subdivided into 2,054 cantons.[129] These cantons are divided into 36,658 communes, which are municipalities with an elected municipal council.[129] Three communes—Paris, Lyon and Marseille—are subdivided into 45 municipal arrondissements.

        Overseas territories and collectivities
        In addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments, the French Republic has five overseas collectivities (French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna), one sui generis collectivity (New Caledonia), one overseas territory (French Southern and Antarctic Lands), and one island possession in the Pacific Ocean (Clipperton Island). Overseas collectivities and territories form part of the French Republic but do not form part of the European Union or its fiscal area (except for Saint Barthélemy, which seceded from Guadeloupe in 2007). The Pacific Collectivities of French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia continue to use the CFP franc[130] whose value is strictly linked to the euro. The five overseas regions use the euro.[131]

        Foreign relations
        Main article: Foreign relations of France
        France is a founding member of the United Nations and serves as one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council with veto rights.[132] In 2015 it was described as "the best networked state in the world" due to its membership in more international institutions than any other country;[133] these include the G7, World Trade Organization,[134] the Pacific Community[135] and the Indian Ocean Commission.[136] It is an associate member of the Association of Caribbean States[137] and a leading member of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie of 84 French-speaking countries.[138]

        La Francophonie map (dozens of countries in Africa, Europe, Asia and Latin America are members of this international organisation.
        88 states and governments are part of La Francophonie,[139] which promotes values of democracy, multilingualism and cultural diversity.[140] France has been a key member of this global organisation since its inception in 1970.

        As a significant hub for international relations, France has the third-largest assembly of diplomatic missions, behind China and the United States. It also hosts the headquarters of several international organisations, including the OECD, UNESCO, Interpol, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and the OIF.[141]

        French foreign policy after World War II has been largely shaped by membership in the European Union, of which it was a founding member. Since the 1963 Élysée Treaty, France has developed close ties with reunified Germany to become the most influential driving force of the EU.[142] Since 1904 France has maintained an "Entente Cordiale" with the United Kingdom, and there has been a strengthening of ties between the countries, especially militarily.

        France is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), but under President Charles de Gaulle excluded itself from the joint military command in protest of the Special Relationship between the U.S. and UK, and to preserve the independence of French foreign and security policies. Under Nicolas Sarkozy, France rejoined the NATO joint military command.[143][144][145]

        France retains strong political and economic influence in its former African colonies (Françafrique)[146] and has supplied economic aid and troops for peacekeeping missions in Ivory Coast and Chad.[147] From 2012 to 2021, France and other African states intervened in support of the Malian government in the Mali War.

        In 2017, France was the world's fourth-largest donor of development aid in absolute terms.[148] This represents 0.43% of its GNP.[149] Aid is provided by the governmental French Development Agency, which finances primarily humanitarian projects in sub-Saharan Africa,[150] with an emphasis on "developing infrastructure, access to health care and education, the implementation of appropriate economic policies and the consolidation of the rule of law and democracy".[150]

        Military
        The French Armed Forces (Forces armées françaises) are the military and paramilitary forces of France, under the president as commander-in-chief. They consist of the French Army (Armée de Terre), the French Navy (Marine Nationale, formerly called Armée de Mer), the French Air and Space Force (Armée de l'Air et de l'Espace), and the National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie nationale), which serves as both military police and civil police in rural areas. Together they are among the largest armed forces in the world and the largest in the EU. According to a 2015 study by Crédit Suisse, the French Armed Forces ranked as the world's sixth-most powerful military and the second most powerful in Europe.[151] France's annual military expenditure in 2023 was US$61.3 billion, or 2.1% of its GDP, making it the eighth biggest military spender in the world.[152] There has been no national conscription since 1997.[153]


        France
        French military interventions since 2001: Afghanistan; Ivory Coast; Chad; Libya; Somalia; Mali; Central African Republic; Syria; Iraq.
        France has been a recognised nuclear state since 1960. It is a party to both the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty[154] and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The French nuclear force (formerly known as "Force de Frappe") consists of four Triomphant-class submarines equipped with submarine-launched ballistic missiles. France has about 60 ASMP medium-range air-to-ground missiles with nuclear warheads;[155] 50 are deployed by the Air and Space Force using the Mirage 2000N long-range nuclear strike aircraft, while around 10 are deployed by the French Navy's Super Étendard Modernisé attack aircraft, which operate from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle.

        France has major military industries and one of the largest aerospace sectors in the world.[156] The country has produced such equipment as the Dassault Rafale fighter, the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, the Exocet missile, and the Leclerc tank, among others. France is a major arms seller,[157][158] with most of its arsenal's designs available for the export market, except for nuclear-powered devices. Weapons exported totalled 27 billion euros in 2022, up from 11.7 billion euros the previous year. The UAE contributed more than 16 billion euros arms to the French total.[159] Among the largest French defence companies are Dassault, Thales and Safran.[160]

        The Directorate General for External Security is a component of the Armed Forces under the authority of the Ministry of Defence. The General Directorate for Internal Security operates under the authority of the Ministry of the Interior.[161] France's cybersecurity capabilities are regularly ranked as some of the most robust of any nation in the world.[162][163]

        Law
        Main article: Law of France
        France uses a civil legal system, wherein law arises primarily from written statutes;[83] judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law in a common law system). Basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the Napoleonic Code (which was largely based on royal law codified under King Louis XIV). In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society.

        color drawing of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen from 1789
        The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.
        French law is divided into two principal areas: private law and public law. Private law includes, in particular, civil law and criminal law. Public law includes, in particular, administrative law and constitutional law. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law, and administrative law. Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminal ex post facto laws are prohibited).[164] While administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries, it is completely separated in France and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court: ordinary courts (which handle criminal and civil litigation) are headed by the Court of Cassation and administrative courts are headed by the Council of State. To be applicable, every law must be officially published in the Journal officiel de la République française.

        France does not recognise religious law as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions; it has long abolished blasphemy laws and sodomy laws. However, "offences against public decency" or disturbing public order have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution.[citation needed]

        France generally has a positive reputation regarding LGBTQ rights.[165] Since 1999, civil unions for homosexual couples have been permitted, and since 2013, same-sex marriage and LGBT adoption are legal.[166] Some consider hate speech laws in France to be too broad or severe, undermining freedom of speech.[167] France has laws against racism and antisemitism,[168] while the 1990 Gayssot Act prohibits Holocaust denial. In 2024, France became the first nation in the European Union to explicitly protect abortion in its constitution.[169]

        Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State is the basis for laïcité (state secularism): the state does not formally recognise any religion, except in Alsace-Moselle, which continues to subsidise education and clergy of Catholicism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Judaism. Nonetheless, France does recognise religious associations. The Parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995 and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004. In 2010, it banned the wearing of face-covering Islamic veils in public; human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch described the law as discriminatory towards Muslims.[170][171] However, it is supported by most of the population.[172]

        Economy

        La Défense, seen from the Eiffel Tower
        La Défense was in 2017 ranked by Ernst & Young as the leading central business district in continental Europe, and fourth in the world.[173]
        France has a social market economy characterised by sizeable government involvement and diversified sectors. For two centuries, it has consistently ranked among the ten largest globally; as of 2025 it is the world's ninth largest by purchasing power parity and second largest in the EU, after Germany.[174] Considered a great power with considerable economic strength,[175] it is a member of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the G20. France ranked 13th in the 2025 Global Innovation Index.[176][177]

        The economy is highly diversified; services represent two-thirds of both the workforce and GDP,[178] while the industrial sector accounts for a fifth of GDP and a similar proportion of employment. France is the third-biggest manufacturing country in Europe, behind Germany and Italy, and ranks eighth in the world by manufacturing output, at 1.9 per cent.[179] Less than 2 per cent of GDP is generated by the primary sector, namely agriculture;[180] the agricultural sector is among the largest in value and leads the EU in overall production.[181]

        In 2018 France was the fifth-largest trading nation and second-largest in Europe, with the value of exports representing over a fifth of GDP.[182] Its membership in the eurozone and the broader European single market facilitates access to capital, goods, services, and skilled labour.[183] Despite protectionist policies over certain industries, particularly in agriculture, France has generally played a leading role in fostering free trade and commercial integration in Europe to enhance its economy.[184][185] In 2019, it ranked first in Europe and 13th in the world in foreign direct investment, with European countries and the United States being leading sources.[186] According to the Bank of France (founded in 1800),[187] the leading recipients of foreign direct investment are manufacturing, real estate, finance and insurance.[188] The Paris Region has the highest concentration of multinational firms in mainland Europe.[188]

        Under the doctrine of dirigisme, the government historically played a major role in the economy; policies such as indicative planning and nationalisation are credited for contributing to three decades of unprecedented postwar economic growth known as Trente Glorieuses. At its peak in 1982, the public sector accounted for one-fifth of industrial employment and over four-fifths of the credit market. Beginning in the late 20th century, regulations and state involvement in the economy were loosened, with most leading companies becoming privately owned; state ownership still dominates transportation, defence and broadcasting.[189] Policies aimed at promoting economic dynamism and privatisation have improved France's economic standing globally: it is among the world's 10 most innovative countries in the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index,[190] and the 15th most competitive, according to the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report.[191]

        The Paris stock exchange is one of the oldest in the world, created in 1724.[192] Some examples of the most valuable French companies include LVMH, L'Oréal and Sociéte Générale.[193] France has historically been one of the world's major agricultural centres and remains a "global agricultural powerhouse"; France is the world's sixth-biggest exporter of agricultural products, generating a trade surplus of over €7.4 billion.[194][195] Nicknamed "the granary of the old continent",[196] over half its total land area is farmland, of which 45 per cent is devoted to permanent field crops such as cereals. The country's diverse climate, extensive arable land, modern farming technology, and EU subsidies have made it Europe's leading agricultural producer and exporter.[197]

        With 102 million international tourist arrivals in 2024, France is the world's top tourist destination[198] and ranks third in tourism-derived income due to the shorter duration of visits.[199] The most popular tourist sites include (annual visitors): Eiffel Tower (6.2 million), Château de Versailles (2.8 million), Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle (2 million), Pont du Gard (1.5 million), Arc de Triomphe (1.2 million), Mont Saint-Michel (1 million), Sainte-Chapelle (683,000), Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg (549,000), Puy de Dôme (500,000), Musée Picasso (441,000), and Carcassonne (362,000).[200]

        France, especially Paris, has some of the world's largest museums including the Louvre, which is the most visited art museum in the world (7.7 million visitors in 2022); the Musée d'Orsay (3.3 million), mostly devoted to Impressionism and voted best museum in the world in 2018;[201] the Musée de l'Orangerie (1.02 million), which is home to eight large Water Lily murals by Claude Monet; and the Centre Pompidou (3 million), dedicated to contemporary art.

        Disneyland Paris is Europe's most popular theme park, with 15 million combined visitors to the resort's Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park in 2009.[202] With more than 10 million tourists per year, the French Riviera is the second leading tourist destination in the country, after the Paris Region.[203] With 6 million tourists per year, the castles of the Loire Valley (French: châteaux) and the Loire Valley are the third leading tourist destination.[204][205]

        France has 52 sites inscribed in UNESCO's World Heritage List and features cities of high cultural interest, beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, as well as rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity (green tourism). Small and picturesque villages are promoted through the association Les Plus Beaux Villages de France (literally "The Most Beautiful Villages of France"). The "Remarkable Gardens" label is a list of the over 200 gardens classified by the Ministry of Culture. This label is intended to protect and promote remarkable gardens and parks. France attracts many religious pilgrims on their way to St. James or to Lourdes, a town in the Hautes-Pyrénées that hosts several million visitors a year.

        Belleville Nuclear Power Plant. France derives most of its electricity from nuclear power, the highest percentage in the world.
        France is the world's tenth-largest producer of electricity.[206] Électricité de France (EDF), which is majority-owned by the French government, is the country's main producer and distributor of electricity and one of the world's largest electric utility companies, ranking third in revenue globally.[207] In 2018, EDF produced roughly one-fifth of the EU's electricity, primarily from nuclear power.[208] In 2021, France was the biggest energy exporter in Europe, mostly to the UK and Italy,[209] and the largest net exporter of electricity in the world.[209]

        Since the 1973 oil crisis, France has pursued a strong policy of energy security,[209] namely through heavy investment in nuclear energy. It is one of 32 countries with nuclear power plants, ranking second in the world by the number of operational nuclear reactors at 56.[210] Consequently, 70% of its electricity is generated by nuclear power, the highest proportion in the world by a wide margin;[211] only Slovakia and Ukraine also derive a majority of electricity from nuclear power, at roughly 53% and 51%, respectively.[212] France is considered a world leader in nuclear technology, with reactors and fuel products being major exports.[209]

        The significant reliance on nuclear power has resulted in comparatively slower adoption of renewable energy relative to other Western nations. Nevertheless, between 2008 and 2019, its production capacity from renewable energies rose consistently and nearly doubled.[213] Hydropower is by far the leading source, accounting for over half of renewable energy sources[214] and contributing 13% of its electricity[213] the third highest proportion in Europe.[214] Most hydroelectric plants, such as Eguzon, Étang de Soulcem, and Lac de Vouglans, are managed by EDF.[214] France aims to further expand hydropower into 2040.[213]

        Transport
        Main article: Transport in France

        Millau Viaduct is the tallest bridge in the world.[215]
        The railway network in France stretches 29,473 kilometres (18,314 mi) as of 2008[216] and is the second most extensive in Western Europe after Germany's.[217] It is operated by the SNCF, and high-speed trains include Thalys, Eurostar and TGV, which travels at 320 km/h (199 mph).[218] Eurostar and LeShuttle connect with the United Kingdom through the Channel Tunnel. Rail connections exist to all other neighbouring countries in Europe except Andorra. Intra-urban connections are also well developed, with most major cities having underground or tramway services complementing bus services.

        There are approximately 1,027,183 kilometres (638,262 mi) of serviceable roadway, ranking it the most extensive network of the European continent.[219] The Paris Region is enveloped with a dense network of roads and highways, which connect it with virtually all parts of the country. Roads also handle substantial international traffic, connecting with cities in neighbouring countries. There is no annual registration fee or road tax; usage of the mostly privately-owned motorways is through tolls except in the vicinity of large communes. The new car market is dominated by domestic brands such as Renault, Peugeot and Citroën.[220] France possesses the Millau Viaduct, the world's tallest bridge,[221] and has built many important bridges such as the Pont de Normandie. Diesel and petrol-driven cars and lorries cause a large part of the country's air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.[222][223]

        There are 464 airports in France.[83] Charles de Gaulle Airport, located in the vicinity of Paris, is the largest and busiest airport in the country, handling the vast majority of popular and commercial traffic and connecting Paris with virtually all major cities across the world. Air France is the national carrier airline, although numerous private airline companies provide domestic and international travel services. There are ten major ports, the largest of which is in Marseille,[224] which also is the largest bordering the Mediterranean Sea.[225] 12,261 kilometres (7,619 mi) of waterways traverse France including the Canal du Midi, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean through the Garonne river.[83]

        Demographics
        Main article: Demographics of France

        Population density in France by arrondissement
        With an estimated population of 68,605,616 people,[6][j] France is the 20th most populous country in the world, the third-most populous in Europe, and the second most populous in the European Union. For much of the 21st century, France has been an outlier among developed countries, particularly in Europe, for its relatively high rate of natural population growth; by birth rates alone, it was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the EU in 2006.[226] Between 2006 and 2016, France saw the second-highest overall increase in population in the EU and was one of four EU countries where natural births accounted for the most population growth.[227] This was the highest rate since the end of the baby boom in 1973 and coincides with the rise in the total fertility rate from a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010.

        Since 2011, the fertility rate has been steadily declining;[228] it stood at 1.79 per woman in 2023,[229] below the replacement rate of 2.1 and well below the high of 4.41 in 1800.[230][231][232] Fertility rate and crude birth rate nonetheless remain the highest in the EU[233] and among the highest in Europe overall, where the average is 1.5.[234] The mean age of French women at the birth of their first child was 29.1, slightly younger than the EU average of 29.7.[233]

        Like many developed nations, the population is aging: The average age is 41.7 years, while roughly one-fifth of French people are 65 or over.[235] It is projected that one in three French will be over 60 by 2024. Life expectancy at birth is 82.7 years, the 12th highest in the world; French Polynesia and Réunion ranked fourth and 11th in life expectancy, at 84.07 years and 83.55, respectively.

        From 2006 to 2011, population growth averaged 0.6 percent per year;[236] since 2011, annual growth has been between 0.4 and 0.5 percent annually,[237] and France is projected to continue growing until 2044.[238] Immigrants are major contributors to this trend; in 2010, roughly one in four newborns (27 percent) in Metropolitan France had at least one foreign-born parent, and another 24 percent had at least one parent born outside Europe (excluding French overseas territories).[239] In 2021, the share of children of foreign-born mothers was 23 percent.[233]

        Major cities
        See also: Functional area (France)
        France is a highly urbanised country, with its largest cities (in terms of metropolitan area population in 2021[240]) being Paris (13,171,056 inh.), Lyon (2,308,818), Marseille (1,888,788), Lille (1,521,660), Toulouse (1,490,640), Bordeaux (1,393,764), Nantes (1,031,953), Strasbourg (864,993), Montpellier (823,120), and Rennes (771,320). (Note: since its 2020 revision of metropolitan area borders, INSEE considers that Nice is a metropolitan area separate from the Cannes-Antibes metropolitan area; these two combined would have a population of 1,019,905, as of the 2021 census). Rural flight was a perennial political issue throughout most of the 20th century.

        Ethnic groups
        Historically, French people were mainly of Celtic-Gallic origin, with a significant admixture of Italic (Romans) and Germanic (Franks) groups reflecting centuries of respective migration and settlement.[241] Through the course of the Middle Ages, France incorporated various neighbouring ethnic and linguistic groups, as evidenced by Breton elements in the west, Aquitanian in the southwest, Scandinavian in the northwest, Alemannic in the northeast, and Ligurian in the southeast.

        Large-scale immigration over the last century and a half have led to a more multicultural society; beginning with the French Revolution and further codified in the French Constitution of 1958, the government is prohibited from collecting data on ethnicity and ancestry; most demographic information is drawn from private sector organisations or academic institutions. In 2004 the Institut Montaigne estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were white (85% of the population), 6 million were northwest African (10%), 2 million were black (3.3%), and 1 million were Asian (1.7%).[242][243]

        A 2008 poll conducted jointly by the Institut national d'études démographiques (INSEE) and the French National Institute of Statistics[244][245] estimated that the largest minority ancestry groups were Italian (5 million), followed by northwest African (3–6 million),[246][247][248] Sub-Saharan African (2.5 million), Armenian (500,000), and Turkish (200,000).[249] There are also sizeable minorities of other European ethnic groups, namely Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, and Greek.[246][250][251] France has a significant Gitan (Romani) population, numbering between 20,000 and 400,000;[252] many foreign Roma are expelled back to Bulgaria and Romania frequently.[253]

        Immigration
        Main article: Immigration to France
        It is estimated that 40% of the French population is descended at least partially from the different waves of immigration since the early 20th century;[254] between 1921 and 1935 alone, about 1.1 million net immigrants came to France.[255] The next largest wave came in the 1960s when around 1.6 million pieds-noirs returned to France following the independence of its northwest African possessions of Algeria and Morocco.[256][257] They were joined by numerous former colonial subjects from North and West Africa, as well as numerous European immigrants from Spain and Portugal.


        The Calais Jungle was a refugee and illegal migrant encampment in the vicinity of Calais, France, that existed from January 2015 to October 2016.
        France remains a major destination for immigrants, accepting about 200,000 legal immigrants annually.[258] In 2005, it was Western Europe's leading recipient of asylum seekers, with an estimated 50,000 applications (albeit a 15% decrease from 2004).[259] In 2010, France received about 48,100 asylum applications—placing it among the top five asylum recipients in the world.[260] In subsequent years it saw the number of applications increase, ultimately doubling to 100,412 in 2017.[261] The European Union allows free movement between the member states, although France established controls to curb Eastern European migration. Foreigners' rights are established in the Code of Entry and Residence of Foreigners and of the Right to Asylum. Immigration remains a contentious political issue.[262]

        In 2008 INSEE estimated that the number of foreign-born immigrants was around 5 million (8% of the population), while their French-born descendants numbered 6.5 million, or 11% of the population. Thus, nearly a fifth of the country's population were either first or second-generation immigrants, of which more than 5 million were of European origin and 4 million of Maghrebi ancestry.[263][264][265] In 2008, France granted citizenship to 137,000 persons, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and Turkey.[266] In 2022, more than 320,000 migrants came to France, with the majority coming from Africa.[267]

        In 2014, the INSEE reported a significant increase in the number of immigrants coming from Spain, Portugal and Italy between 2009 and 2012. According to the institute, this increase resulted from the 2008 financial crisis.[268] Statistics on Spanish immigrants in France show a growth of 107 per cent between 2009 and 2012, with the population growing from 5,300 to 11,000.[268] Of the total of 229,000 foreigners coming to France in 2012, nearly 8% were Portuguese, 5% British, 5% Spanish, 4% Italian, 4% German, 3% Romanian, and 3% Belgian.[268]

        Map of the Francophone world:
        Native language
        Administrative language
        Secondary or cultural language
        The official language is French,[269] a Romance language derived from Latin. Since 1635, the Académie Française has been the official authority on the French language, although its recommendations carry no legal weight. There are also regional languages spoken in France, such as Occitan, Breton, Catalan, Flemish (Dutch dialect), Alsatian (German dialect), Basque, and Corsican (Italian dialect). Italian was the official language of Corsica up to 1859.[270] Although regional languages do not have the status of official languages, they are recognised by Article 75-1 of the constitution as part of France's heritage.[271]

        The government does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals, but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications. The French government tries to promote French in the EU and globally through institutions such as the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. There are 77 vernacular minority languages, eight spoken in Metropolitan France and 69 in the overseas territories.

        According to the 2007 Adult Education survey, part of a project by the European Union and carried out in France by INSEE and based on a sample of 15,350 persons, French is the native language of 87% of the population, or roughly 56 million people, followed by Arabic (3.6%, 2.3 million), Portuguese (1.5%, 960,000), Spanish (1.2%, 770,000) and Italian (1.0%, 640,000).[272]

        Religion
        Main article: Religion in France

        Notre-Dame de Reims is the Catholic cathedral where the Kings of France were crowned until 1825.[k]
        France is a secular country in which freedom of religion is a constitutional right. After alternating between royal and secular republican governments during the 19th century, the 1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State established the concept of laïcité, a strict separation of church and state under which the government and public life are kept completely secular, detached from any religion.[273] Alsace and Moselle, which were part of the German Empire when state secularism was established in France, is an exception since the local law stipulates official status and state funding for Lutheranism, Catholicism, and Judaism.[274]

        Catholicism has been the main religion in France for more than a millennium, and it was once the state religion.[275] Its role nowadays has been greatly reduced; nevertheless in 2012, among the 47,000 religious buildings in France, 94% were Catholic churches.[276] The government is prohibited from recognising specific rights to any religious community (with the exception of legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the aforementioned local law in Alsace-Moselle). It recognises religious organisations according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine, and religious organisations are expected to refrain from intervening in policymaking.[277] Some religious groups, such as scientology, the Children of God, the Unification Church, and the Order of the Solar Temple, are considered cults (sectes in French) and are not granted the same status as recognised religions.[278]

        Health
        Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, stone building with slate dome
        The Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, a teaching hospital in Paris, is one of Europe's largest hospitals.[279]
        The French health care system is one of universal health care largely financed by government national health insurance. In its 2000 assessment of world health care systems, the World Health Organization (WHO) found that France provided the "close to best overall health care" in the world.[280] The French health care system was ranked first worldwide by the WHO in 1997.[281][282] In 2011, France spent 11.6% of its GDP on health care, or US$4,086 per capita,[283] a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in Europe. Approximately 77% of health expenditures are covered by government-funded agencies.[284]

        Care is generally free for people affected by chronic diseases such as cancer, AIDS or cystic fibrosis. The life expectancy at birth is 80 years for men and 85.6 years for women.[285][286] There are 3.2 physicians for every 1000 inhabitants, 5.7 hospital beds for every 1000 inhabitants, and average health care spending per capita was US$8,630 in 2022, representing 12.1% of GDP.[287][288] As of 2007, approximately 140,000 inhabitants (0.4%) are living with HIV/AIDS.[83]

        Education
        Main article: Education in France

        The ENS produces among the most Nobel Prize laureates per capita in the world.[289]
        In 1802, Napoleon created the lycée, the second and final stage of secondary education that prepares students for higher education studies or a profession.[290] Jules Ferry is considered the father of the French modern school, leading reforms in the late 19th century that established free, secular and compulsory education (currently mandatory to age 16).[291][292]

        French education is centralised and divided into three stages: primary, secondary, and higher education. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranked France's education as near the OECD average in 2018.[293][294] School children in France reported greater concern about the disciplinary climate and behaviour in classrooms compared to other OECD countries.[294]

        Higher education is divided between public universities and the prestigious and selective Grandes écoles, such as Sciences Po Paris for political studies, HEC Paris for economics, Polytechnique, the École des hautes études en sciences sociales for social studies and the École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris that produce high-profile engineers, or the École nationale d'administration for careers in the Grands Corps of the state. The Grandes écoles have been criticised for alleged elitism, producing many if not most of France's high-ranking civil servants, CEOs and politicians.[295]

        Culture

        Art
        Further information: French art and Art in Paris

        Claude Monet, founder of the Impressionist movement
        The origins of French art were very much influenced by Flemish art and by Italian art at the time of the Renaissance. Jean Fouquet, the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance firsthand. The Renaissance painting School of Fontainebleau was directly inspired by Italian painters such as Primaticcio and Rosso Fiorentino, who both worked in France. Two of the most famous French artists of the time of the Baroque era, Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain, lived in Italy.

        French artists developed the rococo style in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of the Baroque style, the works of the court-endorsed artists Antoine Watteau, François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as Napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as Jacques-Louis David and the highly influential Académie des Beaux-Arts defined the style known as Academism.

        In the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting grew, with the development of new styles of painting such as Impressionism and Symbolism. The most famous impressionist painters of the period were Camille Pissarro, Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir.[296] The second generation of impressionist-style painters, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Georges Seurat, were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions,[297] as well as the fauvist artists Henri Matisse, André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck.[298][299]

        At the beginning of the 20th century, Cubism was developed by Georges Braque and the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, who was living in Paris.[300] Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, such as Vincent van Gogh and Wassily Kandinsky.[301][302] In the early 20th century and in particular during the interwar period, a loose collection of foreign artists of whom many were Jewish formed the School of Paris. Amongst these artists were Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani, Yitzhak Frenel, Jules Pascin and others.[303] The Second World War led to the deaths or exile of multiple artists, resulting in the relative fall of Paris' domination and centrality in the world art scene in favour of New York City.[304]

        Architecture
        Main article: French architecture

        Saint Louis's Sainte-Chapelle represents the French impact on religious architecture.
        During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers. Some French castles that survive are Chinon, Château d'Angers, Château de Vincennes and the Cathar castles. During this era, France had been using Romanesque architecture like most of Western Europe.

        Gothic architecture, originally named Opus Francigenum meaning "French work",[305] was born in Île-de-France and was the first French style of architecture to be imitated throughout Europe.[306] Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic cathedrals and basilicas, the first of these being the Saint Denis Basilica (used as the royal necropolis); other important French Gothic cathedrals are Notre-Dame de Chartres and Notre-Dame d'Amiens. The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church: Notre-Dame de Reims.[307]

        The final victory in the Hundred Years' War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture. It was the time of the French Renaissance and several artists from Italy were invited to the French court; many residential palaces were built in the Loire Valley, from 1450 as a first reference the Château de Montsoreau.[308] Examples of such residential castles include the Château de Chambord, the Château de Chenonceau, or the Château d'Amboise.

        Following the Renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages, Baroque architecture replaced the traditional Gothic style. Baroque architecture found greater success in the secular domain than in the religious one.[309] In the secular domain, the Palace of Versailles has many Baroque features. Jules Hardouin Mansart, who designed the extensions to Versailles, was one of the most influential French architects of the Baroque era; he is famous for his dome at Les Invalides.[310] Some of the most impressive provincial Baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as Place Stanislas in Nancy. On the military architectural side, Vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over Europe, the Americas, Russia and Turkey.[311][312]

        After the Revolution, the Republicans favoured Neoclassicism although it was introduced in France before the revolution with such buildings as the Parisian Pantheon or the Capitole de Toulouse. Built during the French First Empire, the Arc de Triomphe and Sainte Marie-Madeleine represent the best example of Empire style architecture.[313] Under Napoleon III, a wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth; extravagant buildings such as the neo-Baroque Palais Garnier were built. The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; most notably, Haussmann's renovation of Paris. The architecture associated with this era is named Second Empire in English, the term being taken from the Second French Empire. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. In the late 19th century, Gustave Eiffel designed many bridges, such as the Garabit viaduct, and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the Eiffel Tower.

        In the 20th century, French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier designed several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The Louvre Pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 metres (121 ft).[314] A significant number of skyscrapers are located in the La Défense financial district.[315] Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the Millau Viaduct. Some famous modern French architects include Jean Nouvel, Dominique Perrault, Christian de Portzamparc and Paul Andreu.

        Literature and philosophy

        Victor Hugo, a French Romantic writer and politician
        The earliest French literature dates from the Middle Ages, when there were several languages and dialects, and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of medieval texts, such as Tristan and Iseult and Lancelot-Grail, are unknown. Three famous medieval authors are Chrétien de Troyes, Christine de Pizan (langue d'oïl), and Duke William IX of Aquitaine (langue d'oc). Much medieval French poetry and literature was inspired by the legends of the Carolingian cycle, such as the Song of Roland and the chansons de geste. The Roman de Renart, written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the medieval character Reynard ('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing. An important 16th-century writer was François Rabelais, who wrote five popular early picaresque novels. Rabelais was also in regular communication with Marguerite de Navarre, author of the Heptameron.[316] Michel de Montaigne's most famous work, Essais, started a literary genre.[317]

        French literature and poetry flourished during the 18th and 19th centuries. Denis Diderot is best known as the main editor of the Encyclopédie, whose aim was to sum up all the knowledge of his century and to fight ignorance and obscurantism. Charles Perrault was a prolific writer of children's fairy tales including Puss in Boots, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Bluebeard. At the start of the 19th century, symbolist poetry was an important movement, with poets such as Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé.[318]

        Victor Hugo is sometimes seen as "the greatest French writer of all time"[319] for excelling in all literary genres. Hugo's verse has been compared to that of Shakespeare, Dante and Homer.[320] His novel Les Misérables is widely seen as one of the greatest novels ever written,[321] and The Hunchback of Notre Dame has remained immensely popular. Other major authors of the 19th century include Alexandre Dumas (The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo), Jules Verne (Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas), Émile Zola (Les Rougon-Macquart), Honoré de Balzac (La Comédie humaine), Guy de Maupassant, Théophile Gautier and Stendhal (The Red and the Black, The Charterhouse of Parma).

        In the early 20th century France was a haven for literary freedom.[322] Works banned for obscenity in the US, the UK and other Anglophone nations were published in France decades before they were available in the respective authors' home countries.[322] The French were disinclined to punish literary figures for their writing, and prosecutions were rare.[322] Important writers of the 20th century include Marcel Proust, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Jean Cocteau, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote The Little Prince, which is one of the best selling books in history.[323][324]

        Philosophy
        Medieval French philosophy was dominated by Scholasticism until the emergence of Humanism in the Renaissance. Modern philosophy began in the 17th century with René Descartes, Blaise Pascal and Nicolas Malebranche. Descartes was the first Western philosopher since ancient times to attempt to build a philosophical system from the ground up rather than building on the work of predecessors.[325][326] Major philosophical contributions in the 18th century included Voltaire, who came to embody the Enlightenment, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose work highly influenced the French Revolution.[327][328] French philosophers made major contributions to the field in the 20th century including the existentialist works of Simone de Beauvoir, Camus, and Sartre.[329] Other influential contributors include the moral and political works of Simone Weil, contributions to structuralism including from Claude Lévi-Strauss and the post-structuralist works by Michel Foucault.[330][331]

        Music

        Claude Debussy, a French composer
        French music experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed talented musicians and composers in the royal court. Composers of this period include Marc-Antoine Charpentier, François Couperin, Michel-Richard Delalande, Jean-Baptiste Lully and Marin Marais, all of them composers at the court. After the death of Louis XIV, French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau achieved some prestige. Rameau became the dominant composer of French opera and the leading French composer of the harpsichord.[332]

        In the field of classical music, France has produced notable composers such as Gabriel Fauré, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Hector Berlioz. Debussy and Ravel are the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. The two composers invented new musical forms[333][334][335][336] and new sounds. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed.[337] His music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of atonality. Erik Satie was a key member of the early-20th-century Parisian avant-garde. Francis Poulenc's best-known works are his piano suite Trois mouvements perpétuels (1919), the ballet Les Biches (1923), the Concert champêtre (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera Dialogues des Carmélites (1957) and the Gloria (1959) for soprano, choir and orchestra. In the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Ohana, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Boulez contributed to the evolution of contemporary classical music.[338]

        French music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music in the middle of the 20th century. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, French pop music, known as chanson française, has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are Édith Piaf, Georges Brassens, Léo Ferré, Charles Aznavour and Serge Gainsbourg.[339] Modern pop music has seen the rise of popular French hip hop, French rock, techno/funk, and turntablists/DJs. Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries,[340] bands such as Noir Désir, Mano Negra, Niagara, Les Rita Mitsouko and more recently Superbus, Phoenix and Gojira,[341] or Shaka Ponk, have reached worldwide popularity.

        Cinema

        A Palme d'Or from the Cannes Film Festival, one of the "Big Three" film festivals alongside the Venice Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival[342][343][344]
        France has historical and strong links with cinema, with two Frenchmen, Auguste and Louis Lumière (known as the Lumière Brothers) credited with creating cinema in 1895.[345] The world's first female filmmaker, Alice Guy-Blaché, was also from France.[346] Several important cinematic movements, including the late 1950s and 1960s Nouvelle Vague, began in the country. It is noted for having a strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by the government. France remains a leader in filmmaking, as of 2015 producing more films than any other European country.[347][348] The nation also hosts the Cannes Festival, one of the most important and famous film festivals in the world.[349][350]

        Apart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as Poland (Roman Polanski, Krzysztof Kieślowski, Andrzej Żuławski), Argentina (Gaspar Noé, Edgardo Cozarinsky), Russia (Alexandre Alexeieff, Anatole Litvak), Austria (Michael Haneke) and Georgia (Géla Babluani, Otar Iosseliani) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as Luc Besson, Jacques Tourneur or Francis Veber in the United States. Although the French film market is dominated by Hollywood, France is the only nation in the world where American films make up the smallest share of total film revenues, at 50%, compared with 77% in Germany and 69% in Japan.[351] French films account for 35% of the total film revenues of France, which is the highest percentage of national film revenues in the developed world outside the United States, compared to 14% in Spain and 8% in the UK.[351] In 2013, France was the second-largest exporter of films in the world, after the United States.[352]

        As part of its advocacy of cultural exception, a political concept of treating culture differently from other commercial products,[353] France succeeded in convincing all EU members to refuse to include culture and audiovisuals in the list of liberalised sectors of the WTO in 1993.[354] This decision was confirmed in a vote by UNESCO in 2005.[355]

        Fashion

        Fashion has been an important industry and cultural export of France since the 17th century, and modern "haute couture" originated in Paris in the 1860s. Today, Paris, along with London, Milan, and New York City, is considered one of the world's fashion capitals, and the city is home or headquarters to many of the premier fashion houses. The expression Haute couture is, in France, a legally protected name, guaranteeing certain quality standards.

        The association of France with fashion and style (French: la mode) dates largely to the reign of Louis XIV.[356] France renewed its dominance of the high fashion (French: couture or haute couture) industry in the years 1860–1960 through the establishment of the great couturier houses such as Chanel, Dior, and Givenchy. The French perfume industry is the world leader in its sector and is centred on the town of Grasse.[357]

        According to 2017 data compiled by Deloitte, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LVMH), a French brand, is the largest luxury company in the world by sales, selling more than twice the amount of its nearest competitor.[358] Moreover, France also possesses 3 of the top 10 luxury goods companies by sales (LVMH, Kering SA, L'Oréal), more than any other country in the world.[358]

        Media
        Main article: Telecommunications in France

        Le Figaro was founded in 1826 and is still considered a newspaper of record.[359]
        In 2021, regional daily newspapers, such as Ouest-France, Sud Ouest, La Voix du Nord, Dauphiné Libéré, Le Télégramme, and Le Progrès, more than doubled the sales of national newspapers, such as Le Monde, Le Figaro, L'Équipe (sports), Le Parisien, and Les Echos (finance). Free dailies, distributed in metropolitan centres, continue to increase their market share.[360] The sector of weekly magazines includes more than 400 specialised weekly magazines published in the country.[361]

        The most influential news magazines are the left-wing Le Nouvel Observateur, centrist L'Express and right-wing Le Point (in 2009 more than 400,000 copies),[362] but the highest circulation numbers for weeklies are attained by TV magazines and by women's magazines, among them Marie Claire and ELLE, which have foreign versions. Influential weeklies also include investigative and satirical papers Le Canard Enchaîné and Charlie Hebdo, as well as Paris Match. As in most industrialised nations, the print media have been affected by a severe crisis with the rise of the internet. In 2008, the government launched a major initiative to help the sector reform and become financially independent,[363][364] but in 2009 it had to give €600,000 to help the print media cope with the 2008 financial crisis, in addition to existing subsidies.[365] In 1974, after years of centralised monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agency ORTF was split into several national institutions, but the three already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations[366][367] remained under state control. It was only in 1981 that the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory.[367]

        Cuisine
        Main article: French cuisine

        French wines are usually made to accompany French cuisine.
        Different regions have different styles. In the north, butter and cream are common ingredients, whereas olive oil is more commonly used in the south.[368] Each region of France has traditional specialties: cassoulet in the southwest, choucroute in Alsace, quiche in the Lorraine region, beef bourguignon in Burgundy, Provençal tapenade, etc. France is most famous for its wines[369] and cheeses, which are often named for the territory where they are produced (AOC).[370][371] A meal typically consists of three courses, entrée ('starter'), plat principal ('main course'), and fromage ('cheese') or dessert, sometimes with a salad served before the cheese or dessert.

        French cuisine is also regarded as a key element of the quality of life and the attractiveness of France. A French publication, the Michelin Guide, awards Michelin stars for excellence to a select few establishments.[372][373] The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on the success of a restaurant. By 2006, the Michelin Guide had awarded 620 stars to French restaurants.[374]

        In addition to its wine tradition, France is also a major producer of beer and rum. The three main French brewing regions are Alsace (60% of national production), Nord-Pas-de-Calais, and Lorraine. French rum is made in distilleries on islands in the Atlantic and Indian oceans.[375][376]

        Sports

        Starting in 1903, the Tour de France is the most prestigious of Grands Tours, and the world's most famous cycling race.[377]
        France hosts "the world's biggest annual sporting event", the annual cycling race Tour de France.[378] Other popular sports played in France include football, judo, tennis,[379] rugby union[380] and pétanque. France has hosted events such as the 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups,[381] the 2007 Rugby World Cup,[382] and the 2023 Rugby World Cup.[383] The country also hosted the 1960 European Nations' Cup, UEFA Euro 1984, UEFA Euro 2016 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. The Stade de France in Saint-Denis is France's largest stadium and was the venue for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2007 Rugby World Cup finals. Since 1923, France is famous for its 24 Hours of Le Mans sports car endurance race.[384] Several major tennis tournaments take place in France, including the Paris Masters and the French Open, one of the four Grand Slam tournaments. French martial arts include Savate and Fencing.

        France has a close association with the Modern Olympic Games; it was a French aristocrat, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who suggested the Games' revival, at the end of the 19th century.[385][386] Paris hosted the second Games in 1900,[387] and has hosted the Olympics on five further occasions: the 1924 Summer Olympics, the 2024 Summer Olympics both in Paris[386] and three Winter Games (1924 in Chamonix, 1968 in Grenoble and 1992 in Albertville).[386] France introduced Olympics for deaf people (Deaflympics) in 1924.[388]

        Both the national football team and the national rugby union team are nicknamed "Les Bleus". Football is the most popular sport in France, with over 1,800,000 registered players and over 18,000 registered clubs.[389] Rugby union is popular, particularly in Paris and the southwest of France.[390] The national rugby union team has competed at every Rugby World Cup; it takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship.

        The French Open, also called Roland-Garros, is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks between late May and early June at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris. It is the premier clay court tennis championship event in the world and the second of four annual Grand Slam tournaments.[391]

        <p>New Zealand (Māori: Aotearoa, pronounced [aɔˈtɛaɾɔa] ⓘ) is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It consists of two main landmasses—the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui) and the South Island (Te Waipounamu)—and over 600 smaller islands. It is the sixth-largest island country by area and lies east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and south of the islands of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. The country's varied topography and sharp mountain peaks, including the Southern Alps (Kā Tiritiri o te Moana), owe much to tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, and its most populous city is Auckland.

        The islands of New Zealand were the last large habitable land to be settled by humans. Between about 1280 and 1350, Polynesians began to settle in the islands and subsequently developed a distinctive Māori culture. In 1642, the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight and record New Zealand. In 1769 the British explorer Captain James Cook became the first European to set foot on and map New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of the United Kingdom and Māori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which paved the way for Britain's declaration of sovereignty later that year and the establishment of the Crown Colony of New Zealand in 1841. Subsequently, a series of conflicts between the colonial government and Māori tribes resulted in the alienation and confiscation of large amounts of Māori land. New Zealand became a dominion in 1907; it gained full statutory independence in 1947, retaining the monarch as head of state. Today, the majority of New Zealand's population of around 5.3 million is of European descent; the indigenous Māori are the largest minority, followed by Asians and Pasifika. Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture mainly derives from Māori and early British settlers but has recently broadened from increased immigration. The official languages are English, Māori, and New Zealand Sign Language, with the local dialect of English being dominant.

        A developed country, New Zealand was the first to introduce a minimum wage and give women the right to vote. It ranks very highly in international measures of quality of life and human rights and has one of the lowest levels of perceived corruption in the world. It retains visible levels of inequality, including structural disparities between its Māori and European populations. During the 1980s, New Zealand underwent major economic changes that transformed it from a protectionist to a liberalised free-trade economy. The service sector dominates the country's economy, followed by the industrial sector, and agriculture; international tourism is also a significant source of revenue. New Zealand and Australia have a strong relationship and are considered to share a strong Trans-Tasman identity, stemming from centuries of British colonisation. The country is part of multiple international organisations and forums.

        Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Government, led by the prime minister, currently Christopher Luxon. Charles III is the country's king and is represented by the governor-general, Cindy Kiro. New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes. The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica.

        Etymology
        Further information: New Zealand place names
        Brown square paper with Dutch writing and a thick red, curved line
        Detail from a 1666 map showing the western coastline of Nova Zeelandia (on this map, north is at the bottom)
        The first European visitor to New Zealand, Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, named the islands Staten Land, believing they were part of the Staten Landt that Jacob Le Maire had sighted off the southern end of South America.[18][19] The next year, in 1643, Hendrik Brouwer proved that the South American land was just a small island, and Dutch cartographers subsequently renamed Tasman's discovery Nova Zeelandia from Latin, after the Dutch province of Zeeland.[18][20] This name was later anglicised to New Zealand.[21][22]

        This was written as Nu Tireni in the Māori language (spelled Nu Tirani in Te Tiriti o Waitangi). In 1834, a document written in Māori, "He Wakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni", was translated into English and became the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand. It was prepared by Te W(h)akaminenga o Nga Rangatiratanga o Nga Hapu o Nu Tireni, the United Tribes of New Zealand, and a copy was sent to King William IV, who had already acknowledged the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand and who recognised the declaration in a letter from Lord Glenelg.[23][24]

        Aotearoa (pronounced Māori pronunciation: [aɔˈtɛaɾɔa] ⓘ in Māori and /ˌaʊtɛəˈroʊ.ə/ in English; often translated as 'land of the long white cloud')[25] is the current Māori name for New Zealand. It is unknown whether Māori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of Europeans; Aotearoa originally referred to just the North Island.[26] Māori had several traditional names for the two main islands, including Te Ika-a-Māui ('the fish of Māui') for the North Island and Te Waipounamu ('the waters of greenstone') or Te Waka o Aoraki ('the canoe of Aoraki') for the South Island.[27] Early European maps labelled the islands North (North Island), Middle (South Island), and South (Stewart Island / Rakiura).[28]

        In 1830, mapmakers began to use "North" and "South" on their maps to distinguish the two largest islands, and by 1907, this was the accepted norm.[22] The New Zealand Geographic Board discovered in 2009 that the names of the North Island and South Island had never been formalised, and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013. This set the names as North Island or Te Ika-a-Māui, and South Island or Te Waipounamu.[29] For each island, either its English or Māori name can be used, or both can be used together.[29] Similarly the Māori and English names for the whole country are sometimes used together (Aotearoa New Zealand);[30][31] however, this has no official recognition.[32]

        The Māori people descend from Polynesians whose ancestors emigrated from Taiwan to Melanesia between 3000 and 1000 BCE and then travelled east, reaching the Society Islands c. 1000 CE. After a pause of 200 to 300 years, a new wave of exploration led to the discovery and settlement of New Zealand.[33][34][35]
        The first people to reach New Zealand were Polynesians in ocean going waka, who are believed to have arrived in several waves between about 1280 and 1350. According to most Māori oral traditions, the islands were first discovered by the semi-legendary explorer Kupe while in pursuit of a giant octopus.[36] These traditions hold that Kupe was followed by a great fleet of settlers, who set out from Hawaiki in eastern Polynesia around 1350.[37] The existence of a single great fleet that settled New Zealand has since been superseded by the belief that the majority of settlement was a planned and deliberate event that occurred over several decades.[38][39][40][41][42]

        The exact date of this settlement is unclear, with recent sources favouring settlement in the 14th century. While mitochondrial DNA variability within Māori populations suggest that New Zealand was first settled between 1250 and 1300,[27][43][44] no human remains, artefacts or structures can be reliably dated to earlier than the Kaharoa eruption of Mount Tarawera around 1314.[45] This scenario is also consistent with a debated third line of oral evidence,[46] traditional genealogies (whakapapa) that point to around 1350 as a probable arrival date for several of the migratory waka (canoes) from which many Māori trace their descent.[47][48] Some Māori later migrated to the Chatham Islands, where they developed their distinct Moriori culture;[49] a later 1835 invasion by Māori iwi resulted in the massacre and virtual extinction of the Moriori.[50]

        In a hostile 1642 encounter between Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri and Abel Tasman's crew,[51][52] four of Tasman's crew members were killed and at least one Māori was hit by canister shot.[53] Europeans did not revisit New Zealand until 1769, when British explorer James Cook mapped almost the entire coastline.[52] Following Cook, New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American whaling, sealing, and trading ships. They traded European food, metal tools, weapons, and other goods for timber, Māori food, artefacts, and water.[54]

        The introduction of the potato and the musket transformed Māori agriculture and warfare. Potatoes provided a reliable food surplus, which enabled longer and more sustained military campaigns.[55] The resulting intertribal Musket Wars encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and 1840, killing 30,000–40,000 Māori.[56] From the early 19th century, Christian missionaries began to settle New Zealand, eventually converting most of the Māori population.[57] The Māori population declined to around 40% of its pre-contact level during the 19th century; introduced diseases were the major factor.[58]

        The British Government appointed James Busby as British Resident to New Zealand in 1832.[59] His duties, given to him by Governor Bourke in Sydney, were to protect settlers and traders "of good standing", prevent "outrages" against Māori, and apprehend escaped convicts.[59][60] In 1835, following an announcement of impending French settlement by Charles de Thierry, the nebulous United Tribes of New Zealand sent a Declaration of Independence to King William IV of the United Kingdom asking for protection.[59] Ongoing unrest, the proposed settlement of New Zealand by the New Zealand Company (which had already sent its first ship of surveyors to buy land from Māori) and the dubious legal standing of the Declaration of Independence prompted the Colonial Office to send Captain William Hobson to claim sovereignty for the United Kingdom and negotiate a treaty with the Māori.[61] The Treaty of Waitangi was first signed in the Bay of Islands on 6 February 1840.[62] In response to the New Zealand Company's attempts to establish an independent settlement in Wellington,[63][64] Hobson declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand on 21 May 1840, even though copies of the treaty were still circulating throughout the country for Māori to sign.[65] With the signing of the treaty and declaration of sovereignty, the number of immigrants, particularly from the United Kingdom, began to increase.[66]

        New Zealand was administered as a dependency of the Colony of New South Wales until becoming a separate Crown colony, the Colony of New Zealand, on 3 May 1841.[67][68] Armed conflict began between the colonial government and Māori in 1843 with the Wairau Affray over land and disagreements over sovereignty. These conflicts, mainly in the North Island, saw thousands of imperial troops and the Royal Navy come to New Zealand and became known as the New Zealand Wars. Following these armed conflicts, large areas of Māori land were confiscated by the government to meet settler demands.[69]

        The colony gained a representative government in 1852, and the first Parliament met in 1854.[70] In 1856 the colony effectively became self-governing, gaining responsibility over all domestic matters, except native policy, which was granted in the mid-1860s.[70] Following concerns that the South Island might form a separate colony, premier Alfred Domett moved a resolution to transfer the capital from Auckland to a locality near Cook Strait.[71][72] Wellington was chosen for its central location, with Parliament officially sitting there for the first time in 1865.[73]

        In 1886, New Zealand annexed the volcanic Kermadec Islands, about 1,000 km (620 mi) northeast of Auckland. Since 1937, the islands are uninhabited except for about six people at Raoul Island station. These islands put the northern border of New Zealand at 29 degrees South latitude.[74] After the 1982 UNCLOS, the islands contributed significantly to New Zealand's exclusive economic zone.[75]

        In 1891, the Liberal Party came to power as the first organised political party.[76] The Liberal Government, led by Richard Seddon for most of its period in office,[77] passed many important social and economic measures. In 1893, New Zealand was the first nation in the world to grant all women the right to vote[76] and pioneered the adoption of compulsory arbitration between employers and unions in 1894.[78] The Liberals also guaranteed a minimum wage in 1894, a world first.[79]

        In 1907, at the request of the New Zealand Parliament, King Edward VII proclaimed New Zealand a Dominion within the British Empire,[80] reflecting its self-governing status.[81] In 1947, New Zealand adopted the Statute of Westminster, confirming that the British Parliament could no longer legislate for the country without its consent. The British government's residual legislative powers were later removed by the Constitution Act 1986, and final rights of appeal to British courts were abolished in 2003.[70]

        Early in the 20th century, New Zealand was involved in world affairs, fighting in the First and Second World Wars[82] and suffering through the Great Depression.[83] The depression led to the election of the first Labour Government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy.[84] New Zealand experienced increasing prosperity following the Second World War,[85] and Māori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work.[86] A Māori protest movement developed, which criticised Eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of Māori culture and of the Treaty of Waitangi.[87] In 1975, the Waitangi Tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty, and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985.[62] The government has negotiated settlements of these grievances with many iwi,[88] although Māori claims to the foreshore and seabed proved controversial in the 2000s.[89][90]

        Islands of New Zealand as seen from satellite
        The snow-capped Southern Alps dominate the South Island, while the North Island's Northland Peninsula stretches towards the subtropics.
        New Zealand is near the centre of the water hemisphere and is made up of two main islands and more than 700 smaller islands.[91] The two main islands (the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Māui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamu) are separated by Cook Strait, 22 kilometres (14 mi) wide at its narrowest point.[92] Besides the North and South Islands, the five largest inhabited islands are Stewart Island (across the Foveaux Strait), Chatham Island, Great Barrier Island (in the Hauraki Gulf),[93] D'Urville Island (in the Marlborough Sounds)[94] and Waiheke Island (about 22 km (14 mi) from central Auckland).[95] The nearest continent is Australia to the west north west, with the shortest distance between the Australian and New Zealand mainlands being roughly 1,487 kilometers (924 miles) across the Tasman Sea, specifically between Tasmania and Fiordland. The closest point between any territory of both countries is between Macquarie Island (Australia) and Auckland Island (New Zealand), which are about 618 kilometers (384 miles) apart.

        New Zealand is long and narrow—over 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) along its north-north-east axis with a maximum width of 400 kilometres (250 mi)[96]—with about 15,000 km (9,300 mi) of coastline[97] and a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres (103,500 sq mi).[98] Because of its far-flung outlying islands and long coastline, the country has extensive marine resources. Its exclusive economic zone is one of the world's largest, covering more than 15 times its land area.[99]


        Aoraki / Mount Cook is the highest point in New Zealand, at 3,724 metres.
        The South Island is the largest landmass of New Zealand. It is divided along its length by the Southern Alps.[100] There are 18 peaks over 3,000 metres (9,800 ft), the highest of which is Aoraki / Mount Cook at 3,724 metres (12,218 ft).[101] Fiordland's steep mountains and deep fiords record the extensive ice age glaciation of this southwestern corner of the South Island.[102] The North Island is less mountainous but is marked by volcanism.[103] The highly active Taupō Volcanic Zone has formed a large volcanic plateau, punctuated by the North Island's highest mountain, Mount Ruapehu (2,797 metres (9,177 ft)). The plateau also hosts the country's largest lake, Lake Taupō,[91] nestled in the caldera of one of the world's most active supervolcanoes.[104] New Zealand is prone to earthquakes.

        The country owes its varied topography, and perhaps even its emergence above the waves, to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the Pacific and Indo-Australian Plates.[105] New Zealand is part of Zealandia, a microcontinent nearly half the size of Australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the Gondwanan supercontinent.[106][107] About 25 million years ago, a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region. This is now most evident in the Southern Alps, formed by compression of the crust beside the Alpine Fault. Elsewhere, the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other, producing the Puysegur Trench to the south, the Hikurangi Trough east of the North Island, and the Kermadec and Tonga Trenches[108] further north.[105]

        New Zealand, together with Australia, is part of a wider region known as Australasia.[109] It also forms the southwestern extremity of the geographic and ethnographic region called Polynesia.[110] Oceania is a wider region encompassing the Australian continent, New Zealand, and various island countries in the Pacific Ocean that are not included in the seven-continent model.[111]

        Climate

        Autumn in the Christchurch Botanic Gardens
        New Zealand's climate is predominantly temperate maritime (Köppen: Cfb), with mean annual temperatures ranging from 10 °C (50 °F) in the south to 16 °C (61 °F) in the north.[112] Historical maxima and minima are 42.4 °C (108.32 °F) in Rangiora, Canterbury and −25.6 °C (−14.08 °F) in Ranfurly, Otago.[113] Conditions vary sharply across regions, from extremely wet on the West Coast of the South Island to semi-arid in Central Otago and the Mackenzie Basin of inland Canterbury and subtropical in Northland.[114][115]

        Of the seven largest cities, Christchurch is the driest, receiving on average only 618 millimetres (24.3 in) of rain per year. Wellington is the wettest, receiving almost twice that amount.[116] Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch all receive a yearly average of more than 2,000 hours of sunshine. The southern and southwestern parts of the South Island have a cooler and cloudier climate, with around 1,400–1,600 hours. The northern and northeastern parts of the South Island are the sunniest areas of the country and receive about 2,400–2,500 hours.[117]

        The general snow season is early June until early October, though cold snaps can occur outside this season.[118] Snowfall is common in the eastern and southern parts of the South Island and mountain areas across the country.[112]

        The endemic flightless kiwi is a national icon.
        New Zealand's geographic isolation for 80 million years[120] and island biogeography has influenced evolution of the country's species of animals, fungi and plants. Physical isolation has caused biological isolation, resulting in a dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species.[121][122] The flora and fauna of New Zealand were originally thought to have originated from New Zealand's fragmentation off from Gondwana, however more recent evidence postulates species resulted from dispersal.[123]

        About 82% of New Zealand's indigenous vascular plants are endemic, covering 1,944 species across 65 genera.[124][125] The number of fungi recorded from New Zealand, including lichen-forming species, is not known, nor is the proportion of those fungi which are endemic, but one estimate suggests there are about 2,300 species of lichen-forming fungi in New Zealand[124] and 40% of these are endemic.[126] The two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps, or by southern beech in cooler climates.[127] The remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands, the majority of which are tussock.[128]

        An artist's rendition of a Haast's eagle attacking two moa
        The giant Haast's eagle died out when Māori hunted its main prey, the moa, to extinction.
        Before humans arrived, an estimated 80% of the land was covered in forest, with only high alpine, wet, infertile and volcanic areas without trees.[129] Massive deforestation occurred after humans arrived, with around half the forest cover lost to fire after Polynesian settlement.[130] Much of the remaining forest fell after European settlement, being logged or cleared to make room for pastoral farming, leaving forest occupying only 23% of the land in 1997.[131]

        The forests were dominated by birds, and the lack of mammalian predators led to some, like the kiwi, kākāpō, weka and takahē, evolving flightlessness.[132] The arrival of humans, associated changes to habitat, and the introduction of rats, ferrets and other mammals led to the extinction of many bird species, including large birds like the moa and Haast's eagle.[133][134]

        Other indigenous animals are represented by reptiles (tuatara, skinks and geckos), frogs,[135] such as the protected endangered Hamilton's Frog, spiders,[136] insects (wētā),[137] and snails.[138] Some, such as the tuatara, are so unique that they have been called living fossils.[139] Three species of bats (one since extinct) were the only sign of native land mammals in New Zealand until the 2006 discovery of bones from a unique, mouse-sized land mammal at least 16 million years old.[140][141] Marine mammals are abundant, with almost half the world's cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and large numbers of fur seals reported in New Zealand waters.[142] Many seabirds breed in New Zealand, a third of them unique to the country.[143] More penguin species are found in New Zealand than in any other country, with 13 of the world's 18 penguin species.[144]

        Since human arrival, almost half of the country's vertebrate species have become extinct, including at least 51 birds, three frogs, three lizards, one freshwater fish, and one bat. Others are endangered or have had their range severely reduced.[133] New Zealand conservationists have pioneered several methods to help threatened wildlife recover, including island sanctuaries, pest control, wildlife translocation, fostering, and ecological restoration of islands and other protected areas.[145][146][147][148]

        New Zealand is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy,[149] although its constitution is not codified.[150] Charles III is the King of New Zealand[151] and thus the head of state.[152] The king is represented by the governor-general, whom he appoints on the advice of the prime minister.[153] The governor-general can exercise the Crown's prerogative powers, such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers, ambassadors, and other key public officials,[154] and in rare situations, the reserve powers (e.g. the power to dissolve Parliament or refuse the royal assent of a bill into law).[155] The powers of the monarch and the governor-general are limited by constitutional constraints and cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers.[155]

        The New Zealand Parliament holds legislative power and consists of the king and the House of Representatives.[156] It also included an upper house, the Legislative Council, until this was abolished in 1950.[156] The supremacy of parliament over the Crown and other government institutions was established in England by the Bill of Rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in New Zealand.[156] The House of Representatives is democratically elected, and a government is formed from the party or coalition with the majority of seats. If no majority is formed, a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured.[156] The governor-general appoints ministers under advice from the prime minister, who is by convention the parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition.[157] Cabinet, formed by ministers and led by the prime minister, is the highest policy-making body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions.[158] Members of Cabinet make major decisions collectively and are therefore collectively responsible for the consequences of these decisions.[159] The 42nd and current prime minister, since 27 November 2023, is Christopher Luxon.[160]

        A parliamentary general election must be called no later than three years after the previous election.[161] Almost all general elections between 1853 and 1993 were held under the first-past-the-post voting system.[162] Since the 1996 election, a form of proportional representation called mixed-member proportional (MMP) has been used.[150] Under the MMP system, each person has two votes; one is for a candidate standing in the voter's electorate, and the other is for a party. Based on the 2018 census data, there are 72 electorates (which include seven Māori electorates in which only Māori can optionally vote),[163] and the remaining 48 of the 120 seats are assigned so that representation in Parliament reflects the party vote, with the threshold that a party must win at least one electorate or 5% of the total party vote before it is eligible for a seat.[164] Elections since the 1930s have been dominated by two political parties, National and Labour. More parties have been represented in Parliament since the introduction of MMP.[165]

        New Zealand's judiciary, headed by the chief justice,[166] includes the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, the High Court, and subordinate courts.[167] Judges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain judicial independence.[150] This theoretically allows the judiciary to interpret the law based solely on the legislation enacted by Parliament without other influences on their decisions.[168]

        New Zealand is identified as one of the world's most stable and well-governed states.[169] As of 2023, the country is ranked second in the strength of its democratic institutions,[170] and third in government transparency and lack of corruption.[171] LGBT rights in the nation are also recognised as among the most tolerant in Oceania.[172] New Zealand ranks highly for civic participation in the political process, with 82% voter turnout during recent general elections, compared to an OECD average of 69%.[173] But this is untrue of local council elections; a historically low 36% of eligible New Zealanders voted in the 2022 local elections, compared with an already low 42% turnout in 2019.[174][175][176] A 2017 human rights report by the United States Department of State noted that the New Zealand government generally respected the rights of individuals, but voiced concerns regarding the social status of the Māori population.[177] The New Zealand Human Rights Commission has asserted that there is strong, consistent evidence that structural discrimination is a real and ongoing socioeconomic issue.[178] One example of structural inequality in New Zealand can be seen in the criminal justice system. According to the Ministry of Justice, Māori are overrepresented, comprising 45% of New Zealanders convicted of crimes and 53% of those imprisoned, while only being 16.5% of the population.[179][180]

        Map of regions (coloured) and territorial authorities (outlined) in New Zealand
        The early European settlers divided New Zealand into provinces, which had a degree of autonomy.[181] Because of financial pressures and the desire to consolidate railways, education, land sales, and other policies, government was centralised and the provinces were abolished in 1876.[182] The provinces are remembered in regional public holidays[183] and sporting rivalries.[184]

        Since 1876, various councils have administered local areas under legislation determined by the central government.[181][185] In 1989, the government reorganised local government into the current two-tier structure of regional councils and territorial authorities.[186] The 249 municipalities[186] that existed in 1975 have now been consolidated into 67 territorial authorities and 11 regional councils.[187] The regional councils' role is to regulate "the natural environment with particular emphasis on resource management",[186] while territorial authorities are responsible for sewage, water, local roads, building consents, and other local matters.[188][189] Five of the territorial councils are unitary authorities and also act as regional councils.[189] The territorial authorities consist of 13 city councils, 53 district councils, and the Chatham Islands Council. While officially the Chatham Islands Council is not a unitary authority, it undertakes many functions of a regional council.[190]

        The Realm of New Zealand, one of 15 Commonwealth realms,[191] is the entire area over which the king or queen of New Zealand is sovereign and comprises New Zealand, Tokelau, the Ross Dependency, the Cook Islands, and Niue.[149] The Cook Islands and Niue are self-governing states in free association with New Zealand.[192][193] The New Zealand Parliament cannot pass legislation for these countries, but with their consent can act on behalf of them in foreign affairs and defence. Tokelau is classified as a non-self-governing territory, but is administered by a council of three elders (one from each Tokelauan atoll).[194] The Ross Dependency is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica, where it operates the Scott Base research facility.[195] New Zealand nationality law treats all parts of the realm equally, so most people born in New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau, and the Ross Dependency are New Zealand citizens.[196][n 8]

        During the period of the New Zealand colony, Britain was responsible for external trade and foreign relations.[198] The 1923 and 1926 Imperial Conferences decided that New Zealand should be allowed to negotiate its own political treaties, and the first commercial treaty was ratified in 1928 with Japan. On 3 September 1939, New Zealand allied itself with Britain and declared war on Germany with Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage proclaiming, "Where she goes, we go; where she stands, we stand".[199]

        In 1951, the United Kingdom became increasingly focused on its European interests,[200] while New Zealand joined Australia and the United States in the ANZUS security treaty.[201] The influence of the United States on New Zealand weakened following protests over the Vietnam War,[202] the refusal of the United States to admonish France after the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior,[203] disagreements over environmental and agricultural trade issues, and New Zealand's nuclear-free policy.[204][205] Despite the United States's suspension of ANZUS obligations, the treaty remained in effect between New Zealand and Australia, whose foreign policy has followed a similar historical trend.[206] Close political contact is maintained between the two countries, with free trade agreements and travel arrangements that allow citizens to visit, live and work in both countries without restrictions.[207] In 2013 there were about 650,000 New Zealand citizens living in Australia, which is equivalent to 15% of the population of New Zealand.[208]

        New Zealand has a strong presence among the Pacific Island countries, and enjoys strong diplomatic relations with Samoa, Fiji, and Tonga, and among smaller nations.[209] A large proportion of New Zealand's aid goes to these countries, and many Pacific people migrate to New Zealand for employment. The increase of this since the 1960s led to the formation of the Pasifika New Zealander pan-ethnic group, the fourth-largest ethnic grouping in the country.[210][211] Permanent migration is regulated under the 1970 Samoan Quota Scheme and the 2002 Pacific Access Category, which allow up to 1,100 Samoan nationals and up to 750 other Pacific Islanders respectively to become permanent New Zealand residents each year. A seasonal workers scheme for temporary migration was introduced in 2007, and in 2009 about 8,000 Pacific Islanders were employed under it.[212] New Zealand is involved in the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Community, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum (including the East Asia Summit).[207] New Zealand has been described as a middle power in the Asia-Pacific region,[213] and an emerging power.[214][215] The country is a member of the United Nations,[216] the Commonwealth of Nations[217] and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),[218] and participates in the Five Power Defence Arrangements.[219]

        Today, New Zealand enjoys particularly close relations with the United States and is one of its major non-NATO allies,[220] as well as with Australia, with a "Trans-Tasman" identity between citizens of the latter being common.[221] New Zealand is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing agreement, known formally as the UKUSA Agreement. The five members of this agreement compromise the core Anglosphere: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[222] Since 2012, New Zealand has had a partnership arrangement with NATO under the Partnership Interoperability Initiative.[223][224][225] According to the 2024 Global Peace Index, New Zealand is the 4th most peaceful country in the world.[226]

        New Zealand's military services—the New Zealand Defence Force—comprise the Royal New Zealand Navy, the New Zealand Army and the Royal New Zealand Air Force.[227] New Zealand's national defence needs are modest since a direct attack is unlikely.[228] However, its military has had a global presence. The country fought in both world wars, with notable campaigns in Gallipoli, Crete,[229] El Alamein,[230] and Cassino.[231] The Gallipoli campaign played an important part in fostering New Zealand's national identity[232][233] and strengthened the ANZAC tradition it shares with Australia.[234]

        In addition to Vietnam and the two world wars, New Zealand fought in the Second Boer War,[235] the Korean War,[236] the Malayan Emergency,[237] the Gulf War, and the Afghanistan War. It has contributed forces to several regional and global peacekeeping missions, such as those in Cyprus, Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Sinai, Angola, Cambodia, the Iran–Iraq border, Bougainville, East Timor, and the Solomon Islands.[238]

        New Zealand has an advanced market economy,[239] ranked 16th in the 2022 Human Development Index,[240] and fourth in the 2022 Index of Economic Freedom.[241] It is a high-income economy with a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of United States dollar48,071 as of 2023.[242] The currency is the New Zealand dollar, informally known as the "Kiwi dollar"; it also circulates in the Cook Islands (see Cook Islands dollar), Niue, Tokelau, and the Pitcairn Islands.[243]

        Historically, extractive industries have contributed strongly to New Zealand's economy, focusing at different times on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber.[244] The first shipment of refrigerated meat on the Dunedin in 1882 led to the establishment of meat and dairy exports to Britain, a trade which provided the basis for strong economic growth in New Zealand.[245] High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s.[246] In 1973, New Zealand's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community[247] and other compounding factors, such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crises, led to a severe economic depression.[248] Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe, and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank.[249] In the mid-1980s New Zealand deregulated its agricultural sector by phasing out subsidies over a three-year period.[250][251] Since 1984, successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring (known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia), rapidly transforming New Zealand from a protectionist and highly regulated economy to a liberalised free-trade economy.[252][253] New Zealand's gold production in 2015 was 12 tonnes.[254]

        Unemployment peaked just above 10% in 1991 and 1992,[256] following the 1987 share market crash, but eventually fell to 3.7% in 2007 (ranking third from twenty-seven comparable OECD nations).[256] However, the 2008 financial crisis had a major effect on New Zealand, with the GDP shrinking for five consecutive quarters, the longest recession in over thirty years,[257][258] and unemployment rising back to 7% in late 2009.[259] The lowest unemployment rate recorded using the current methodology was in December 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, at 3.2%.[260] Unemployment rates for different age groups follow similar trends but are consistently higher among youth. During the September 2021 quarter, the general unemployment rate was around 3.2%, while the unemployment rate for youth aged 15 to 24 was 9.2%.[256][261] New Zealand has experienced a series of "brain drains" since the 1970s[262] that still continue today.[263] Nearly one-quarter of highly skilled workers live overseas, mostly in Australia and Britain, which is the largest proportion from any developed nation.[264] In recent decades, however, a "brain gain" has brought in educated professionals from Europe and less developed countries.[265][266] Today New Zealand's economy benefits from a high level of innovation.[267]

        Poverty in New Zealand is characterised by growing income inequality; wealth in New Zealand is highly concentrated,[268] with the top 1% of the population owning 16% of the country's wealth, and the richest 5% owning 38%, leaving a stark contrast where half the population, including state beneficiaries and pensioners, receive less than $24,000.[269] Moreover, child poverty in New Zealand has been identified by the Government as a major societal issue;[270][271] the country has 12.0% of children living in low-income households that have less than 50% of the median equivalised disposable household income as of June 2022.[272] Poverty has a disproportionately high effect in ethnic-minority households, with a quarter (23.3%) of Māori children and almost a third (28.6%) of Pacific Islander children living in poverty as of 2020.[270]

        Trade
        New Zealand is heavily dependent on international trade,[273] particularly in agricultural products.[274] Exports account for 24% of its output,[97] making New Zealand vulnerable to international commodity prices and global economic slowdowns. Food products made up 55% of the value of all the country's exports in 2014; wood was the second largest earner (7%).[275] New Zealand's main trading partners, as at June 2018, are China (NZ$27.8b), Australia ($26.2b), the European Union ($22.9b), the United States ($17.6b), and Japan ($8.4b).[276] On 7 April 2008, New Zealand and China signed the New Zealand–China Free Trade Agreement, the first such agreement China has signed with a developed country.[277] In July 2023, New Zealand and the European Union entered into the EU–New Zealand Free Trade Agreement, which eliminated tariffs on several goods traded between the two regions.[278] This free trade agreement expanded on the pre-existing free trade agreement[279] and saw a reduction in tariffs on meat and dairy[280] in response to feedback from the affected industries.[281]

        The service sector is the largest sector in the economy, followed by manufacturing and construction and then farming and raw material extraction.[97] Tourism plays a significant role in the economy, contributing $12.9 billion (or 5.6%) to New Zealand's total GDP and supporting 7.5% of the total workforce in 2016.[282] In 2017, international visitor arrivals were expected to increase at a rate of 5.4% annually up to 2022.[282]

        Wool has historically been one of New Zealand's major exports.
        Wool was New Zealand's major agricultural export during the late 19th century.[244] Even as late as the 1960s it made up over a third of all export revenues,[244] but since then its price has steadily dropped relative to other commodities,[283] and wool is no longer profitable for many farmers.[284] In contrast, dairy farming increased, with the number of dairy cows doubling between 1990 and 2007,[285] to become New Zealand's largest export earner.[286] In the year to June 2018, dairy products accounted for 17.7% ($14.1 billion) of total exports,[276] and the country's largest company, Fonterra, controls almost one-third of the international dairy trade.[287] Other exports in 2017–18 were meat (8.8%), wood and wood products (6.2%), fruit (3.6%), machinery (2.2%) and wine (2.1%).[276] New Zealand's wine industry has followed a similar trend to dairy, the number of vineyards doubling over the same period,[288] overtaking wool exports for the first time in 2007.[289][290]

        Infrastructure
        In 2015, renewable energy generated 40.1% of New Zealand's gross energy supply.[291] The majority of the country's electricity supply is generated from hydroelectric power, with major schemes on the Waikato, Waitaki and Clutha / Mata-Au rivers, as well as at Manapouri. Geothermal power is also a significant generator of electricity, with several large stations located across the Taupō Volcanic Zone in the North Island. The four main companies in the generation and retail market are Contact Energy, Genesis Energy, Mercury Energy and Meridian Energy. State-owned Transpower operates the high-voltage transmission grids in the North and South Islands, as well as the Inter-Island HVDC link connecting the two together.[291]

        The provision of water supply and sanitation is generally of good quality. Regional authorities provide water abstraction, treatment and distribution infrastructure to most developed areas.[292][293]

        New Zealand's transport network comprises 94,000 kilometres (58,410 mi) of roads, including 199 kilometres (124 mi) of motorways,[294] and 4,128 kilometres (2,565 mi) of railway lines.[97] Most major cities and towns are linked by bus services, although the private car is the predominant mode of transport.[295] The country's railways were privatised in 1993 but were re-nationalised by the government in stages between 2004 and 2008. The state-owned enterprise KiwiRail now operates the railways, with the exception of commuter services in Auckland and Wellington, which are operated by Auckland One Rail and Transdev Wellington respectively.[296] Railways run the length of the country, although most lines now carry freight rather than passengers.[297] The road and rail networks in the two main islands are linked by roll-on/roll-off ferries between Wellington and Picton, operated by Interislander (part of KiwiRail) and Bluebridge. Most international visitors arrive via air.[298] New Zealand has four international airports: Auckland, Christchurch, Queenstown and Wellington; however, only Auckland and Christchurch offer non-stop flights to countries other than Australia or Fiji.[299]

        The New Zealand Post Office had a monopoly over telecommunications in New Zealand until 1987 when Telecom New Zealand was formed, initially as a state-owned enterprise and then privatised in 1990.[300] Chorus, which was split from Telecom (now Spark) in 2011,[301] still owns the majority of the telecommunications infrastructure, but competition from other providers has increased.[300] A large-scale rollout of gigabit-capable fibre to the premises, branded as Ultra-Fast Broadband, began in 2009 with a target of being available to 87% of the population by 2022.[302] As of 2017, the United Nations International Telecommunication Union ranks New Zealand 13th in the development of information and communications infrastructure.[303]

        Science and technology

        New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford has been described as "the father of nuclear physics".
        Early indigenous contribution to science in New Zealand was by Māori tohunga accumulating knowledge of agricultural practice and the effects of herbal remedies in the treatment of illness and disease.[304] Cook's voyages in the 1700s and Darwin's in 1835 had important scientific botanical and zoological objectives.[305] The establishment of universities in the 19th century fostered scientific discoveries by notable New Zealanders including Ernest Rutherford for splitting the atom, William Pickering for rocket science, Maurice Wilkins for helping discover DNA, Beatrice Tinsley for galaxy formation, Archibald McIndoe for plastic surgery, Sydney Smith for forensics and Alan MacDiarmid for conducting polymers.[306]

        Crown Research Institutes (CRIs) were formed in 1992 from existing government-owned research organisations. Their role is to research and develop new science, knowledge, products and services across the economic, environmental, social and cultural spectrum for the benefit of New Zealand.[307] The total gross expenditure on research and development (R&D) as a proportion of GDP rose to 1.37% in 2018, up from 1.23% in 2015. New Zealand ranks 21st in the OECD for its gross R&D spending as a percentage of GDP.[308] New Zealand was ranked 26th in the Global Innovation Index in 2025.[309][310]

        The New Zealand Space Agency was created by the government in 2016 for space policy, regulation and sector development. Rocket Lab was the first commercial rocket launcher in the country.[311]

        Most private and commercial research organisations in New Zealand focus on the agricultural and fisheries sectors. Examples include the Cawthron Institute, the Livestock Improvement Corporation, the Fonterra Research and Development Centre, the Bragato Research Institute, the Kiwifruit Breeding Centre, and B+LNZ Genetics.

        Population pyramid (2017)
        The 2023 New Zealand census enumerated a resident population of 4,993,923, an increase of 6.3% over the 2018 census figure.[4] As of October 2025, the total population has risen to an estimated 5,231,143.[312] New Zealand's population increased at a rate of 1.9% per year in the seven years ended June 2020. In September 2020 Statistics New Zealand reported that the population had climbed above 5 million people in September 2019, according to population estimates based on the 2018 census.[313][n 9]

        New Zealand's population today is concentrated to the north of the country, with around 76.5% of the population living in the North Island and 23.5% in the South Island as of June 2024.[315] During the 20th century, New Zealand's population drifted north. In 1921, the country's median centre of population was in the Tasman Sea west of Levin in Manawatū-Whanganui; by 2017, it had moved 280 km (170 mi) north to near Kawhia in Waikato.[316]

        New Zealand is a predominantly urban country, with 84.7% of the population living in urban areas and 51.2% in the seven cities with populations exceeding 100,000.[315] Auckland, with over 1.4 million residents, is by far the largest city.[315] New Zealand cities generally rank highly on international livability measures. For instance, in 2016, Auckland was ranked the world's third most liveable city and Wellington the twelfth by the Mercer Quality of Living Survey.[317]

        The median age of the New Zealand population at the 2018 census was 37.4 years,[318] with life expectancy in 2017–2019 being 80.0 years for males and 83.5 years for females.[319] While New Zealand is experiencing sub-replacement fertility, with a total fertility rate of 1.6 in 2020, the fertility rate is above the OECD average.[320][321] By 2050, the median age is projected to rise to 43 years and the percentage of people 60 years of age and older to rise from 18% to 29%.[322] In 2016 the leading cause of death was cancer at 30.3%, followed by ischaemic heart disease (14.9%) and cerebrovascular disease (7.4%).[323] As of 2016, total expenditure on health care (including private sector spending) is 9.2% of GDP.[324]

        In the 2023 census, 62.1% of residents responded as being ethnically New Zealand European, and 17.8% responded as being ethnically Māori. Other major ethnicities include Chinese (5.2%), Indian (5.1%), Samoan (4.3%), Filipino (2.2%), Tongan (2.0%), Cook Islands Maori (1.9%), and English (1.4%)[4] 13.2% responded with multiple enthicities, with 8.2% alone responding as both European and Māori.[325] Statistics New Zealand allows people to choose multiple ethnictities and reports ethnic data based on total responses, therefore ethnicties add up to more than 100%. For legacy systems which can only accept one ethnicity, people are usually allocated to a single ethnicity based on a pre-determined priority order, with Māori given highest priority and New Zealand European given lowest priority.[326]

        The population has become more multicultural and diverse in recent decades: in 1961, the census reported that the population of New Zealand was 92% European and 7% Māori, with Asian and Pacific minorities sharing the remaining 1%.[327] However, New Zealand's non-European population is disproportionately concentrated in the North Island and especially in the Auckland Region: while Auckland is home to 33% of New Zealand's population, it is home to 62% of the country's Pasifika population and 60% of its Asian population.[4]

        While the demonym for a New Zealand citizen is New Zealander, the informal "Kiwi" is commonly used both internationally[328] and by locals.[329] The Māori loanword Pākehā has been used to refer to New Zealanders of European descent, although some reject this name. The word today is increasingly used to refer to all non-Polynesian New Zealanders.[330]

        The Māori were the first people to reach New Zealand, followed by the early European settlers. Following colonisation, immigrants were predominantly from Britain, Ireland and Australia because of restrictive policies similar to the White Australia policy.[331] There was also significant Dutch, Dalmatian,[332] German, and Italian immigration, together with indirect European immigration through Australia, North America, South America and South Africa.[333][334] Net migration increased after the Second World War; in the 1970s and 1980s policies on immigration were relaxed, and immigration from Asia was promoted.[334][335] In 2009–10, an annual target of 45,000–50,000 permanent residence approvals was set by the New Zealand Immigration Service—more than one new migrant for every 100 New Zealand residents.[336]

        In the 2023 census, 28.8% of people counted were not born in New Zealand, up from 27.4% in the 2018 census. The most popular countries of origin for overseas-born residents were England (14.6%), mainland China (10.2%), India (10.0%), the Philippines (7.0%), South Africa (6.7%), Australia (6.1%), Fiji (4.8%) and Samoa (4.3%).[337] The number of fee-paying international students and international exchange students increased sharply in the late 1990s, with more than 20,000 studying in public tertiary institutions in 2002.[338] New Zealand achieved a record net migration gain of 135,500 people in the year ended October 2023.[339] Immigrants from India, China and the Philippines are the largest contributors to New Zealand's population growth.[340]

        More than 50%
        English is the predominant language in New Zealand, spoken by 95.4% of the population.[342] New Zealand English has a distinctive accent and lexicon.[343] It is similar to Australian English, and many speakers from the Northern Hemisphere are unable to tell the accents apart.[344] The most prominent differences between New Zealand English and other English dialects are the shifts in the short front vowels: the short-i sound (as in kit) has centralised towards the schwa sound (the a in comma and about); the short-e sound (as in dress) has moved towards the short-i sound; and the short-a sound (as in trap) has moved to the short-e sound.[345]

        After World War II, Māori were discouraged or prohibited to speak their own language (te reo Māori) in schools and workplaces, and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas.[346] The Native Schools Act 1867 required instruction in English in all schools, and while no official policy banned children from speaking Māori, many suffered physical abuse if they did.[347][348][349] The Māori language has recently undergone a process of revitalisation,[350] being declared one of New Zealand's official languages in 1987,[351] and is spoken by 4.0% of the population.[342][n 10] There are now Māori language-immersion schools and two television channels that broadcast predominantly in Māori.[353] Many places have both their Māori and English names officially recognised.[354]

        As recorded in the 2018 census,[342] Samoan is the most widely spoken non-official language (2.2%), followed by "Northern Chinese" (including Mandarin, 2.0%), Hindi (1.5%), and French (1.2%). New Zealand Sign Language was reported to be understood by 22,986 people (0.5%); it became one of New Zealand's official languages in 2006.[355]

        At the 2023 census, 51.6% of population said they had no religion,[357] up from 48.2% in 2018 census.[342] Christians are the single largest religious group, forming 32.3% of the population,[357] compared to 36.5% in 2018.[342] Hindus are the second largest religious minority, forming the 2.9% of population, followed by Muslims on 1.5%.[357] The Auckland Region exhibited the greatest religious diversity.[358]

        Education
        Main articles: Education in New Zealand and Tertiary education in New Zealand
        Primary and secondary schooling is compulsory for children aged 6 to 16, with the majority of children attending from the age of 5.[359] There are 13 school years and attending state (public) schools is free to New Zealand citizens and permanent residents from a person's 5th birthday to the end of the calendar year following their 19th birthday.[360] New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99%,[97] and over half of the population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification.[359]

        There are five types of government-owned tertiary institutions: universities, colleges of education, polytechnics, specialist colleges, and wānanga,[361] in addition to private training establishments.[362] In 2021, in the population aged 25–64, 13% had no formal qualification, 21% had a school qualification, 28% had a tertiary certificate or diploma, and 35% have a bachelor's degree or higher.[363] The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment ranks New Zealand as the 28th best in the OECD for maths, 13th best for science, and 11th best for reading.[364]

        Early Māori adapted the tropically based east Polynesian culture in line with the challenges associated with a larger and more diverse environment, eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social organisation was largely communal with families (whānau), subtribes (hapū) and tribes (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira), whose position was subject to the community's approval.[365] The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture,[366][367] particularly with the introduction of Christianity.[368] However, Māori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity, and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples.[369] More recently, American, Australian, Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand. Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika, the world's largest Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland.[370]

        The largely rural life in early New Zealand led to the image of New Zealanders as rugged, industrious problem solvers.[371] Modesty was expected and enforced through the "tall poppy syndrome", where high achievers received harsh criticism.[372] At the time, New Zealand was not known as an intellectual country.[373] From the early 20th century until the late 1960s, Māori culture was suppressed by the attempted assimilation of Māori into British New Zealanders.[346] In the 1960s, as tertiary education became more available, and cities expanded[374] urban culture began to dominate,[375] but rural imagery and themes are common in New Zealand's art, literature and media.[376]

        New Zealand's national symbols are influenced by natural, historical, and Māori sources. The silver fern emblem appears on army insignia and sporting team uniforms.[377] Certain items of popular culture thought to be unique to New Zealand are called "Kiwiana".[377]

        As part of the resurgence of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised, and Māori artists are increasing in number and influence.[378] Most Māori carvings feature human figures, generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking, detailed head or a stylised version.[379] Surface patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings.[380] The pre-eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses (wharenui) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations. These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and adapting to different whims or needs.[381]

        Māori decorated the white wood of buildings, canoes and cenotaphs using red (a mixture of red ochre and shark fat) and black (made from soot) paint and painted pictures of birds, reptiles and other designs on cave walls.[382] Māori tattoos (moko) consisting of coloured soot mixed with gum were cut into the flesh with a bone chisel.[383] Since European arrival paintings and photographs have been dominated by landscapes, originally not as works of art but as factual portrayals of New Zealand.[384] Portraits of Māori were also common, with early painters often portraying them as an ideal race untainted by civilisation.[384] The country's isolation delayed the influence of European artistic trends allowing local artists to develop their own distinctive style of regionalism.[385] During the 1960s and 1970s, many artists combined traditional Māori and Western techniques, creating unique art forms.[386] New Zealand art and craft has gradually achieved an international audience, with exhibitions in the Venice Biennale in 2001 and the "Paradise Now" exhibition in New York in 2004.[378][387]

        Māori cloaks are made of fine flax fibre and patterned with black, red and white triangles, diamonds and other geometric shapes.[388] Greenstone was fashioned into earrings and necklaces, with the most well-known design being the hei-tiki, a distorted human figure sitting cross-legged with its head tilted to the side.[389] Europeans brought English fashion etiquette to New Zealand, and until the 1950s most people dressed up for social occasions.[390] Standards have since relaxed and New Zealand fashion has received a reputation for being casual, practical and lacklustre.[391][392] However, the local fashion industry has grown significantly since 2000, doubling exports and increasing from a handful to about 50 established labels, with some labels gaining international recognition.[392]

        Literature
        Main article: New Zealand literature
        Māori quickly adopted writing as a means of sharing ideas, and many of their oral stories and poems were converted to the written form.[393] Most early English literature was obtained from Britain, and it was not until the 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand literature started to become widely known.[394] Although still largely influenced by global trends (modernism) and events (the Great Depression), writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in New Zealand. During this period, literature changed from a journalistic activity to a more academic pursuit.[395] Participation in the world wars gave some New Zealand writers a new perspective on New Zealand culture and with the postwar expansion of universities local literature flourished.[396] Dunedin is a UNESCO City of Literature.[397]

        New Zealand music has been influenced by blues, jazz, country, rock and roll and hip hop, with many of these genres given a unique New Zealand interpretation.[398] Māori developed a varied musical tradition around songs and chants, including ceremonial performances, laments, and love songs.[399] Instruments (taonga pūoro), such as flutes and percussion, began being used as spiritual tools, entertainment, and signalling devices.[400][401] Early settlers brought over their ethnic music, with brass bands and choral music being popular, and musicians began touring New Zealand in the 1860s.[402][403] Pipe bands became widespread during the early 20th century.[404] The New Zealand recording industry began to develop from 1940 onwards, and many New Zealand musicians have obtained success in Britain and the United States.[398] Some artists release Māori language songs, and the Māori tradition-based art of kapa haka (song and dance) has made a resurgence.[405] The New Zealand Music Awards are held annually by Recorded Music NZ; the awards were first held in 1965 by Reckitt & Colman as the Loxene Golden Disc awards.[406] Recorded Music NZ also publishes the country's official weekly record charts.[407]

        Public radio was introduced in New Zealand in 1922.[409] A state-owned television service began in 1960.[410] Deregulation in the 1980s saw a sudden increase in the numbers of radio and television stations.[411] New Zealand television primarily broadcasts American and British programming, along with many Australian and local shows.[412] The number of New Zealand films significantly increased during the 1970s. In 1978 the New Zealand Film Commission started assisting local film-makers, and many films attained a world audience, some receiving international acknowledgement.[411] The highest-grossing New Zealand films are Hunt for the Wilderpeople, Boy, The World's Fastest Indian, Whale Rider, Once Were Warriors, Tinā, Heavenly Creatures, What We Do in the Shadows and The Piano.[413][414][415] The country's diverse scenery and compact size, plus government incentives,[416] have encouraged some producers to shoot very big-budget and well known productions in New Zealand, including The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film trilogies, Avatar, The Chronicles of Narnia, King Kong, Wolverine, The Last Samurai, The Power of the Dog, Alien Covenant, Mulan, and A Minecraft Movie.[417][418][419] The New Zealand media industry is dominated by a small number of companies, most of which are foreign-owned, although the state retains ownership of some television and radio stations.[420] Since 1994, Freedom House has consistently ranked New Zealand's press freedom in the top twenty, with the 19th freest media as of 2015.[421]

        The national cuisine has been described as Pacific Rim, incorporating the native Māori cuisine and diverse culinary traditions introduced by settlers and immigrants from Europe, Polynesia, and Asia.[422] New Zealand yields produce from land and sea—most crops and livestock, such as maize, potatoes and pigs, were gradually introduced by the early European settlers.[423] Distinctive ingredients or dishes include lamb, salmon, kōura (crayfish),[424] Bluff oysters, whitebait, pāua (abalone), mussels, scallops, pipi and tuatua (types of New Zealand shellfish),[425] kūmara (sweet potato), kiwifruit, tamarillo, and pavlova (considered a national dessert).[426][422] A hāngī is a traditional Māori method of cooking food using heated rocks buried in a pit oven that is still used for large groups on special occasions,[427] such as tangihanga.[428]

        Most of the major sporting codes played in New Zealand have British origins.[429] Rugby union is considered the national sport[430] and attracts the most spectators.[431] Golf, netball, tennis and cricket have the highest rates of adult participation, while netball, rugby union and football (soccer) are particularly popular among young people.[431][432] Horse racing is one of the most popular spectator sports in New Zealand and was part of the "rugby, racing, and beer" subculture during the 1960s.[433] Around 54% of New Zealand adolescents participate in sports for their school.[432] Victorious rugby tours to Australia and the United Kingdom in the late 1880s and the early 1900s played an early role in instilling a national identity.[434] Māori participation in European sports was particularly evident in rugby, and the country's team performs a haka, a traditional Māori challenge, before international matches.[435] New Zealand is known for its extreme sports, adventure tourism[436] and strong mountaineering tradition, as seen in the success of notable New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary summiting Mount Everest first.[437][438] Other outdoor pursuits such as cycling, fishing, swimming, running, tramping, canoeing, hunting, snowsports, surfing and sailing are also popular.[439] New Zealand has seen regular sailing success in the America's Cup regatta since 1995.[440] The Polynesian sport of waka ama racing has experienced a resurgence of interest in New Zealand since the 1980s.[441]

        New Zealand has competitive international teams in rugby union, rugby league, netball, cricket, softball, and sailing. New Zealand participated at the Summer Olympics in 1908 and 1912 as a joint team with Australia, before first participating on its own in 1920.[442] The country has ranked highly on a medals-to-population ratio at recent Games.[443][444][445] The All Blacks, the national rugby union team, are the most successful in the history of international rugby.[446] They have won the Rugby World Cup three times.[447]

        New Zealand is ranked 5th in the International Cricket Council Men's Test Team Rankings 2025 with a rating of 100.[448]

        <p>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain,[m] is a country in Northwestern Europe, off the coast of the continental mainland. It comprises England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland,[n] with a population of over 69 million in 2024. The UK includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and most of the smaller islands within the British Isles, covering 94,354 square miles (244,376 km2).[f] It shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the English Channel, the Celtic Sea and the Irish Sea, while maintaining sovereignty over the British Overseas Territories. The capital and largest city of both England and the UK is London; Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast are the national capitals of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

        Britain has been inhabited since the Neolithic. In AD 43, the Roman conquest of Britain began. The Roman departure was followed by Anglo-Saxon settlement. In 1066 the Normans conquered England. With the end of the Wars of the Roses the Kingdom of England stabilised and began to flourish, resulting by the 16th century in the annexation of Wales and the establishment of the British Empire. Over the course of the 17th century the role of the British monarchy was reduced, particularly as a result of the English Civil War. In 1707 the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland united under the Treaty of Union to create the Kingdom of Great Britain. In the Georgian era the office of prime minister became established. The Acts of Union 1800 incorporated the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. Most of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922 as the Irish Free State, and the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 created the present United Kingdom.

        The UK became the first industrialised country and was the world's foremost power for the majority of the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly during the Pax Britannica between 1815 and 1914. The British Empire was the leading economic power for most of the 19th century, a position supported by its agricultural prosperity, its role as a dominant trading nation, a massive industrial capacity, significant technological achievements, and the rise of 19th-century London as the world's principal financial centre. At its height in the 1920s the empire encompassed almost a quarter of the world's landmass and population, and was the largest empire in history. However, its involvement in the First World War and the Second World War damaged Britain's economic power, and a global wave of decolonisation led to the independence of most British colonies.

        The UK is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy[o] with three distinct jurisdictions: England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own governments and parliaments which control various devolved matters. A developed country with an advanced economy, the UK ranks amongst the largest economies by nominal GDP and is one of the world's largest exporters and importers. As a nuclear state with one of the highest defence budgets, the UK maintains one of the strongest militaries in Europe. Its soft power influence can be observed in the legal and political systems of many of its former colonies, and British culture remains globally influential, particularly in language, literature, music and sport. A great power, the UK is part of numerous international organisations and forums.

        Etymology and terminology

        See also: Britain (place name) and Terminology of the British Isles
        The Acts of Union 1707 declared that the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were "United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain".[p][22] The term "United Kingdom" has occasionally been used as a description for the former Kingdom of Great Britain, although its official name from 1707 to 1800 was simply "Great Britain".[23] The Acts of Union 1800 formed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Following the partition of Ireland and the independence of the Irish Free State in 1922, which left Northern Ireland as the only part of the island of Ireland within the United Kingdom, the name was changed in 1927 to the "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland".[24]

        Although the United Kingdom is a sovereign country, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also widely referred to as countries.[25] The UK Prime Minister's website has used the phrase "countries within a country" to describe it.[26] Some statistical summaries, such as those for the twelve NUTS 1 regions, refer to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as "regions".[27] Northern Ireland is also referred to as a "province".[28] With regard to Northern Ireland, the descriptive name used "can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences".[29]

        The term "Great Britain" conventionally refers to the island of Great Britain, or politically to England, Scotland and Wales in combination.[30] It is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the United Kingdom as a whole.[31] The word England is occasionally used incorrectly to refer to the United Kingdom as a whole, a mistake principally made by people from outside the UK.[32]

        The term "Britain" is used as a synonym for Great Britain,[33][34] but also sometimes for the United Kingdom.[35][34] Usage is mixed: the UK Government style guide prefers the term "UK" rather than "Britain" or "British" (except when referring to embassies[q]),[37] while other government documents acknowledge that both terms refer to the United Kingdom and that elsewhere "British government" is used at least as frequently as "United Kingdom government".[38] The UK Permanent Committee on Geographical Names recognises "United Kingdom", "UK" and "U.K." as shortened and abbreviated geopolitical terms for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in its toponymic guidelines; it does not list "Britain" but notes that "it is only the one specific nominal term 'Great Britain' which invariably excludes Northern Ireland".[38] The BBC historically preferred to use "Britain" as shorthand only for Great Britain, though the present style guide does not take a position except that "Great Britain" excludes Northern Ireland.[39]

        The adjective "British" is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the United Kingdom and is used in law to refer to United Kingdom citizenship and nationality.[40][r] People of the United Kingdom use several different terms to describe their national identity and may identify themselves as being British, English, Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish or Irish;[43] or as having a combination of different national identities.[44]

        Stonehenge in Wiltshire is a ring of stones, each about 4 m (13 ft) high, 2 m (7 ft) wide and 25 tonnes, erected 2400–2200 BC.
        Settlement by Cro-Magnons of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago.[45] The island has been continuously inhabited only since the last retreat of the ice around 11,500 years ago.[46] By the end of the region's prehistoric period, the population is thought to have belonged largely to a culture termed Insular Celtic, comprising Brittonic Britain and Gaelic Ireland.[47]

        The Roman conquest, beginning in AD 43, and the 400-year rule of southern Britain, was followed by an invasion by Germanic Anglo-Saxon settlers, reducing the Brittonic area mainly to what was to become Wales, Cornwall and, until the latter stages of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, the Hen Ogledd (northern England and parts of southern Scotland).[48] Most of the region settled by the Anglo-Saxons became unified as the Kingdom of England in the 10th century.[49] Meanwhile, Gaelic speakers in north-west Britain (with connections to the north-east of Ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century)[50] united with the Picts to create the Kingdom of Scotland in the 9th century.[51]

        In 1066 the Normans invaded England from northern France. After conquering England they seized large parts of Wales, conquered much of Ireland and were invited to settle in Scotland, bringing to each country feudalism on the Northern French model and Norman-French culture.[52] The Anglo-Norman ruling class greatly influenced, but eventually assimilated with, the local cultures.[53] Subsequent medieval English kings completed the conquest of Wales and tried unsuccessfully to annex Scotland. Asserting its independence in the 1320 Declaration of Arbroath, Scotland maintained its independence thereafter, albeit in near-constant conflict with England.[54]

        In 1215 Magna Carta was the first document to state that no government was above the law, that citizens have rights protecting them, and that they were entitled to a fair trial.[55]

        The English monarchs, through inheritance of substantial territories in France and claims to the French crown, were also heavily involved in conflicts in France, most notably the Hundred Years' War, while the Kings of Scots were in an alliance with the French during this period.[56] Early modern Britain saw religious conflict resulting from the Reformation and the introduction of Protestant state churches in each country.[57] The English Reformation ushered in political, constitutional, social and cultural change in the 16th century and established the Church of England. It defined a national identity for England and slowly, but profoundly, changed people's religious beliefs.[58] Wales was fully incorporated into the Kingdom of England,[59] and Ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the English crown.[60] In what was to become Northern Ireland, the lands of the independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and given to Protestant settlers from England and Scotland.[61]


        The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the Battle of Hastings, 1066, and the events leading to it.
        In 1603 the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland were united in a personal union when James VI of Scotland inherited the crowns of England and Ireland and moved his court from Edinburgh to London; each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political, legal and religious institutions.[62]

        In the mid-17th century, all three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars (including the English Civil War) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy, with the execution of King Charles I, and the establishment of the short-lived unitary republic of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland.[63]

        Although the monarchy was restored, the Interregnum along with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the subsequent Bill of Rights 1689 in England and Claim of Right Act 1689 in Scotland ensured that, unlike much of the rest of Europe, royal absolutism would not prevail, and a professed Catholic could never accede to the throne. The British constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system.[64] With the founding of the Royal Society in 1660, science was greatly encouraged. During this period, particularly in England, the development of naval power and the interest in voyages of discovery led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies, particularly in North America and the Caribbean.[65]

        Though previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within Great Britain in 1606, 1667, and 1689 had proved unsuccessful, the attempt initiated in 1705 led to the Treaty of Union of 1706 being agreed and ratified by both parliaments.

        Union of England and Scotland
        Main articles: Treaty of Union and Kingdom of Great Britain

        The Treaty of Union which unified the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland on 1 May 1707
        On 1 May 1707 the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed, the result of the Acts of Union 1707 between the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland.[66] In the 18th century cabinet government developed under Robert Walpole, in practice the first prime minister (1721–1742). A series of Jacobite uprisings sought to remove the Protestant House of Hanover from the throne and restore the Catholic House of Stuart. The Jacobites were finally defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, after which the Scottish Highlanders were forcibly assimilated into Scotland by revoking the feudal independence of clan chiefs. The British colonies in North America that broke away in the American War of Independence became the United States. British imperial ambition turned towards Asia, particularly to India.[67]

        British merchants played a leading part in the Atlantic slave trade, mainly between 1662 and 1807 when British or British-colonial slave ships transported nearly 3.3 million slaves from Africa.[68] The slaves were taken to work on plantations, principally in the Caribbean but also in North America.[69] However, with pressure from the abolitionist movement, Parliament banned the trade in 1807, banned slavery in the British Empire in 1833, and Britain took a leading role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide through the blockade of Africa and pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties.[70]

        United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
        Main articles: History of the United Kingdom, Acts of Union 1800, and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland

        Victoria reigned as Queen of the United Kingdom and Empress of India during the 19th century.
        In 1800 the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union, uniting the two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 January 1801.[71]

        After the defeat of France at the end of the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815) the United Kingdom emerged as the principal naval and imperial power (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830).[72] Unchallenged at sea, British dominance was later described as the Pax Britannica ("British Peace"), a period of relative peace amongst the great powers (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and foremost power[73][74] and adopted the role of global policeman.[75][76] From 1853 to 1856 Britain took part in the Crimean War, allied with the Ottoman Empire against Tsarist Russia,[77] participating in the naval battles of the Baltic Sea known as the Åland War in the Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland, amongst others.[78] Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 the British government led by Lord Palmerston assumed direct rule over India. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of regions such as East Asia and Latin America.[79]

        Throughout the Victorian era (1837–1901) political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies. Beginning with the Great Reform Act in 1832, Parliament gradually widened the voting franchise, with the 1884 Reform Act championed by William Gladstone granting suffrage to a majority of males for the first time. The British population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses.[80] By the late 19th century the Conservative Party under Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Salisbury initiated a period of imperial expansion in Africa, maintained a policy of "splendid isolation" in Europe, and attempted to contain the influence of the Russian Empire in Afghanistan and Persia, in what came to be known as the Great Game.[81] During this time Canada, Australia and New Zealand were granted self-governing dominion status.[82] At the turn of the century, Britain's industrial dominance became challenged by the German Empire and the United States.[83] The Edwardian era (1901–1910) included social reform and home rule for Ireland become important domestic issues, while the Labour Party emerged from an alliance of trade unions and small socialist groups in 1900, and suffragettes campaigned for women's right to vote.[84]

        Britain was one of the principal Allies that defeated the Central Powers in the First World War (1914–1918). Alongside their French, Russian and (after 1917) American counterparts,[85] British armed forces were engaged across much of the British Empire and in several regions of Europe, particularly on the Western Front.[86] The high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men, with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order. Britain had suffered 2.5 million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt.[86]

        The consequences of the war persuaded the government to expand the right to vote in national and local elections to all adult men and most adult women with the Representation of the People Act 1918.[86] After the war Britain became a permanent member of the Executive Council of the League of Nations and received a mandate over a number of former German and Ottoman colonies. Under the leadership of David Lloyd George, the British Empire reached its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of its population.[87]

        By the mid-1920s most of the British population could listen to BBC radio programmes.[88][89] Experimental television broadcasts began in 1929 and the first scheduled BBC Television Service commenced in 1936.[90] The rise of Irish nationalism, and disputes within Ireland over the terms of Irish Home Rule, led eventually to the partition of the island in 1921.[91] A period of conflict in what is now Northern Ireland occurred from June 1920 until June 1922. The Irish Free State became independent, initially with Dominion status in 1922, and unambiguously independent in 1931. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom.[92] The 1928 Equal Franchise Act gave women electoral equality with men in national elections. Strikes in the mid-1920s culminated in the General Strike of 1926. Britain had still not recovered from the effects of the First World War when the Great Depression (1929–1932) led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas, as well as political and social unrest with rising membership in communist and socialist parties. A coalition government was formed in 1931.[93]

        Nonetheless, Britain was described as "a very wealthy country, formidable in arms, ruthless in pursuit of its interests and sitting at the heart of a global production system."[94] After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Britain entered the Second World War. Winston Churchill became prime minister and head of a coalition government in 1940. Despite the defeat of its European allies in the first year, Britain and its empire continued the war against Germany. Churchill engaged industry, scientists and engineers to support the government and the military in the prosecution of the war effort.[94]

        In 1940 the Royal Air Force defeated the German Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain. Urban areas suffered heavy bombing during the Blitz. The Grand Alliance of Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union formed in 1941, leading the Allies against the Axis powers. There were eventual hard-fought victories in the Battle of the Atlantic, the North Africa campaign and the Italian campaign. British forces played important roles in the Normandy landings of 1944 and the liberation of Europe. The British Army led the Burma campaign against Japan, and the British Pacific Fleet fought Japan at sea. British scientists contributed to the Manhattan Project whose task was to build a nuclear weapon.[95] Once built, it was decided, with British consent, to use the weapon against Japan.[96]

        Post-war 20th century
        Main articles: Post-war Britain (1945–1979) and Social history of post-war Britain (1945–1979)

        The British Empire at its territorial peak in 1921
        The UK was one of the Big Three powers (along with the US and the Soviet Union) who met to plan the post-war world;[97] it drafted the Declaration by United Nations with the United States and became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. It worked closely with the United States to establish the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and NATO.[98] The war left the UK severely weakened and financially dependent on the American Marshall Plan,[99] but it was spared the total war that devastated eastern Europe.[100]

        In the immediate post-war years the Labour government under Clement Attlee initiated a radical programme of reforms, which significantly affected British society in the following decades.[101] Major industries and public utilities were nationalised, a welfare state was established, and a comprehensive, publicly funded healthcare system, the National Health Service, was created.[102] The rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with Britain's much-diminished economic position after its involvement in the First World War and the Second World War, so that a policy of decolonisation was unavoidable.[103][104][105] Independence was granted to India and Pakistan in 1947.[106] Over the next three decades, most colonies of the British Empire gained their independence, and many became members of the Commonwealth of Nations.[107]

        The UK was the third country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal, with its first atomic bomb test, Operation Hurricane, in 1952, but the post-war limitations of Britain's international role were illustrated by the Suez Crisis of 1956. The international spread of the English language, the world's most-widely-spoken language and third-most-spoken native language,[108] ensured the continuing international influence of its literature and its culture.[109][110] As a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s, the government encouraged immigration from Commonwealth countries. In the following decades the UK became a more multiracial and multicultural society.[111] Despite rising living standards in the late 1950s and 1960s, the UK's economic performance was less successful than many of its main competitors such as France, West Germany and Japan. The UK was the first democratic nation to lower its voting age to 18 in 1969.[112]

        In the decades-long process of European integration the UK was a founding member of the Western European Union, established with the London and Paris Conferences in 1954. In 1960 the UK was one of the seven founding members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), but in 1973 it left to join the European Communities (EC). In a 1975 referendum 67 per cent voted to stay in it.[113] When the EC became the European Union (EU) in 1992, the UK was one of the 12 founding member states.

        From the late 1960s, Northern Ireland experienced communal and paramilitary violence, sometimes affecting other parts of the UK, known as the Troubles. It is usually considered to have ended with the 1998 Belfast "Good Friday" Agreement.[114] Following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the Conservative government of the 1980s led by Margaret Thatcher initiated a radical policy of monetarism, deregulation, particularly of the financial sector (for example, the Big Bang in 1986) and labour markets, the sale of state-owned companies (privatisation), and the withdrawal of subsidies to others.[115]


        HMS Invincible returns after defeating Argentine forces in the Falklands War in 1982.
        In 1982 Argentina invaded the British territories of South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, leading to the 10-week Falklands War in which Argentine forces were defeated. The inhabitants of the islands are predominantly descendants of British settlers, and strongly favour British sovereignty, expressed in a 2013 referendum. From 1984 the British economy was helped by the inflow of substantial North Sea oil revenues.[116] Another British Overseas Territory, Gibraltar, ceded to Great Britain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht,[117] is a key military base. A referendum in 2002 on shared sovereignty with Spain was rejected by 98.97 per cent of voters in Gibraltar.

        Around the end of the 20th century, there were major changes to the governance of the UK with the establishment of devolved administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.[118] The statutory incorporation followed acceptance of the European Convention on Human Rights. The UK remained a great power with global diplomatic and military influence and a leading role in the United Nations and NATO.[119]

        21st century
        Main articles: Political history of the United Kingdom (1979–present) and Social history of the United Kingdom (1979–present)

        Prime Minister Boris Johnson signs the Brexit withdrawal agreement in 2020, formally withdrawing the UK from the European Union (EU).
        The UK broadly supported the United States' approach to the "war on terror" in the early 21st century.[120] British troops fought in the war in Afghanistan, but controversy surrounded Britain's military deployment in Iraq, which saw the largest protest in British history in opposition to the government led by Tony Blair.[121]

        The Great Recession (2007–2010) severely affected the British economy,[122] and was followed by a period of weak growth and stagnation.[123][124] The Cameron–Clegg coalition government of 2010 introduced austerity measures intended to tackle the substantial public deficits.[125] A referendum on Scottish independence in 2014 resulted in the Scottish electorate voting by 55.3 to 44.7 per cent to remain part of the United Kingdom.[126]

        In 2016, 51.9 per cent of voters in the UK voted to leave the European Union (EU).[127] The UK left the EU in 2020.[128] On 1 May 2021 the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement came into force which is a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU.[129][130]

        The COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on the British economy, caused major disruptions to education and had far-reaching impacts on society and politics in 2020 and 2021.[131][132][133] The UK was the first country in the world to use an approved COVID-19 vaccine, developing its own vaccine through a collaboration between the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, which allowed the UK's vaccine rollout to be amongst the fastest in the world.[134][135]

        Geography
        Main articles: Geography of the United Kingdom, Fauna of Great Britain, and Flora of Great Britain and Ireland

        A satellite image of the United Kingdom excluding Shetland
        The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately 94,354 square miles (244,376 km2),[f][12] with a land area of 93,723 square miles (242,741 km2).[12] It occupies the major part of the British Isles[136] and includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and some smaller surrounding islands, meaning it comprises England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.[137]

        Geographically, the United Kingdom lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the southeast coast coming within 22 miles (35 km) of the coast of northern France, from which it is separated by the English Channel.[138]

        The nearby island polities of the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey are crown dependencies, in union with the British monarch, but do not strictly form part of the United Kingdom or any of its three jurisdictions or four countries, although the British government retains responsibility for their external affairs. The Isle of Man lies roughly midway between Great Britain and the island of Ireland in the Irish Sea, while the Channel Islands lie just off the northern French coast.

        The Royal Greenwich Observatory in London was chosen as the defining point of the Prime Meridian[139] at the International Meridian Conference in 1884.[140]

        The UK lies between latitudes 49° and 61° N, and longitudes 9° W and 2° E. Northern Ireland shares a 310-mile (499 km) land boundary with the Republic of Ireland[138] and has a 404-mile (650 km) coastline.[141] The length of coastline of Great Britain plus its principal islands is about 19,491 miles (31,368 km) long, with the coastline of the main island Great Britain being 11,073 miles (17,820 km) of that,[142] though measurements can vary greatly due to the coastline paradox.[143] It is connected to continental Europe by the Channel Tunnel, which at 31 miles (50 km) (24 miles (38 km) underwater) is the longest underwater tunnel in the world.[144]

        The UK contains four terrestrial ecoregions: Celtic broadleaf forests, English Lowlands beech forests, North Atlantic moist mixed forests, and Caledonian conifer forests.[145] The area of woodland in the UK was estimated to be 3.25 million hectares in 2023, which represents 13 per cent of the UK's land area.[146]

        Climate
        Main articles: Climate of the United Kingdom and Climate change in the United Kingdom
        Further information: Climate of England, Climate of Scotland, Climate of Northern Ireland, and Climate of Wales
        Most of the United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with generally cool temperatures and plentiful rainfall all year round.[138] The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below 0 °C (32 °F) or rising above 30 °C (86 °F).[147] Some parts, away from the coast, of upland England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland, experience a subpolar oceanic climate. Higher elevations in Scotland experience a continental subarctic climate and the mountains experience a tundra climate.[148]

        The prevailing wind is from the southwest and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean,[138] although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind. Since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions, the eastern parts are the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed by the Gulf Stream, bring mild winters, especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground. Summers are warmest in the southeast of England and coolest in the north. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills.[149]

        The average total annual sunshine in the United Kingdom was 1,339.7 hours between 1971 and 2000,[150] which is just under 30% of the maximum possible.[citation needed] The hours of sunshine vary from 1,200 to about 1,580 hours per year. Since 1996 the UK has been receiving above the 1,981 to 2,010 average hours of sunshine.[151]

        Climate change has a serious impact on the country. A third of food price rise in 2023 was attributed to climate change.[152] In 2024 the United Kingdom ranked 5th out of 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index.[153] A law has been passed that UK greenhouse gas emissions will be net zero by 2050.[154]

        Topography

        The United Kingdom's topography
        England accounts for 53 per cent of the UK, covering 50,350 square miles (130,395 km2).[155] Most of the country consists of lowland terrain,[156] with upland and mountainous terrain northwest of the Tees–Exe line which roughly divides the UK into lowland and upland areas. Lowland areas include Cornwall, the New Forest, the South Downs and the Norfolk Broads. Upland areas include the Lake District, the Pennines, the Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor and Dartmoor. The main rivers and estuaries are the Thames, Severn, and the Humber. England's highest mountain is Scafell Pike, at 978 metres (3,209 ft) in the Lake District; its largest island is the Isle of Wight.

        Scotland accounts for 32 per cent of the UK, covering 30,410 square miles (78,772 km2).[157] This includes nearly 800 islands,[158] notably the Hebrides, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands. Scotland is the most mountainous constituent country of the UK. The Highlands to the north and west are the more rugged region containing the majority of Scotland's mountainous land, including the Cairngorms, Loch Lomond and The Trossachs and Ben Nevis which at 1,345 metres (4,413 ft)[159] is the highest point in the British Isles.[160]

        Wales accounts for less than 9 per cent of the UK, covering 8,020 square miles (20,779 km2).[161] It is mostly mountainous, though South Wales is less mountainous than North and Mid Wales. The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia and include Snowdon (Welsh: Yr Wyddfa) which, at 1,085 metres (3,560 ft), is the highest peak in Wales.[156] Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,704 kilometres) of coastline including the Pembrokeshire Coast.[142] Several islands lie off the Welsh mainland, the largest of which is Anglesey (Ynys Môn).

        Northern Ireland, separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea and North Channel, has an area of 5,470 square miles (14,160 km2) and is mostly hilly. It includes Lough Neagh which, at 150 square miles (388 km2), is the largest lake in the British Isles by area,[162] Lough Erne, which has over 150 islands, and the Giant's Causeway, which is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard in the Mourne Mountains at 852 metres (2,795 ft).[156]

        Politics
        Main articles: Politics of the United Kingdom, Government of the United Kingdom, and Monarchy of the United Kingdom
        Further information: Constitution of the United Kingdom

        Charles III, king

        Keir Starmer, prime minister
        The UK is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy[163] operating under the Westminster system, otherwise known as a "democratic parliamentary monarchy".[164] It is a centralised, unitary state[165][166] wherein the Parliament of the United Kingdom is sovereign.[167] Parliament is made up of the elected House of Commons, the appointed House of Lords and the Crown (as personified by the monarch).[s][170] The main business of Parliament takes place in the two houses,[170] but royal assent is required for a bill to become an act of Parliament (that is, statute law).[171] As a result of parliamentary sovereignty, the British constitution is uncodified, consisting mostly of disparate written sources, including parliamentary statutes, judge-made case law and international treaties, together with constitutional conventions.[172] Nevertheless, the Supreme Court recognises a number of principles underlying the British constitution, such as parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, democracy and upholding international law.[173]

        King Charles III is the monarch and head of state of the UK and 14 other independent sovereign states. These 15 countries are referred to as "Commonwealth realms". The monarch is formally vested with all executive authority as the personal embodiment of the Crown and is "fundamental to the law and working of government in the UK".[174] The disposition of such powers however, including those belonging to the royal prerogative, is generally exercised only on the advice of ministers of the Crown responsible to Parliament and thence to the electorate. Nevertheless, in the performance of official duties the monarch has "the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn".[175] In addition the monarch has a number of reserve powers at his disposal to uphold responsible government and prevent constitutional crises.[t]

        For general elections (elections to the House of Commons), the UK is divided into 650 constituencies, each of which is represented by one member of Parliament (MP) elected by the first-past-the-post system.[177] MPs hold office for up to five years and must then stand for re-election if they wish to continue to be an MP.[177] The Conservative Party, colloquially known as the Tory Party or the Tories, and the Labour Party have been the dominant political parties in the country since the 1920s, leading to the UK being described as a two-party system. However, since the 1920s other political parties have won seats in the House of Commons, although never more than the Conservatives or Labour.[178]

        The Palace of Westminster in London is the seat of both houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
        The prime minister is the head of government in the UK.[179] Acting under the direction and supervision of a Cabinet of senior ministers selected and led by the prime minister, His Majesty's Government serves as the principal instrument for public policymaking, administers public services and, through the Privy Council, promulgates statutory instruments and tenders advice to the monarch.[180][181][182] Nearly all prime ministers have served concurrently as First Lord of the Treasury[183] and all prime ministers have continuously served as First Lord of the Treasury since 1905,[184] Minister for the Civil Service since 1968,[185] and Minister for the Union since 2019.[186] While appointed by the monarch, in modern times the prime minister is, by convention, an MP, the leader of the political party with the most seats in the House of Commons, and holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons.[187][188][189] The prime minister as of 5 July 2024 is Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party.

        Although not part of the United Kingdom, the three Crown Dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, as well as the 14 British Overseas Territories, are subject to the sovereignty of the British Crown. The Crown exercises its responsibilities in relation to the Crown Dependencies mainly through the British government's Home Office and for the British Overseas Territories principally through the Foreign Office.[190]

        Administrative divisions
        Main articles: Countries of the United Kingdom, Administrative geography of the United Kingdom, and List of counties in the United Kingdom

        The four countries of the United Kingdom
        The geographical division of the United Kingdom into counties or shires began in England and Scotland in the early Middle Ages, and was completed throughout Great Britain and Ireland by the early modern period.[191] Modern local government by elected councils, partly based on the ancient counties, was established by separate Acts of Parliament: in England and Wales in 1888, Scotland in 1889 and Ireland in 1898, meaning there is no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across the UK,[192] and England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each have their own distinct jurisdictions.[193] Until the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function.[194]

        Local government in England is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements. The upper-tier subdivisions of England are the nine regions, used primarily for statistical purposes.[195] One of the regions, Greater London, has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a 1998 referendum.[196]

        Local government in Scotland is divided into 32 council areas with a wide variation in size and population. The cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee are separate council areas, as is the Highland Council, which includes a third of Scotland's area but only just over 200,000 people. Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are 1,223.[197]

        Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself. These include the cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, which are unitary authorities in their own right.[198] Elections are held every four years under the first-past-the-post system.[198]

        Local government in Northern Ireland since 1973 has been organised into 26 district councils, each elected by single transferable vote. Their powers are limited to services such as waste collection, dog control, and maintaining parks and cemeteries.[199] In 2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils to replace the existing system.[200]

        Devolution
        Main article: Devolution in the United Kingdom
        Further information: Devolved, reserved and excepted matters

        Prime Minister Keir Starmer meets with the first ministers of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales during the Council of Nations and Regions summit.
        In the United Kingdom a process of devolution has transferred various powers from the UK Government to three of the four UK countries—Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales—as well as to the regions of England, which since 1999 have their own governments and parliaments which control various devolved matters.[201] These powers vary and have been moved to the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and in England, the Greater London Authority and Combined Authorities.[202] Amongst the devolved parliaments across the United Kingdom, the Scottish Parliament has the most extensive responsibilities for devolved powers, and has been described as "one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world".[203][204]

        The UK has an uncodified constitution and constitutional matters are not amongst the powers that have been devolved. Under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the Scottish Parliament, Senedd or Northern Ireland Assembly.[205] Though in the Scotland Act 2016 and the Wales Act 2017 it states that the Scottish Government and the Welsh Government "are a permanent part of the United Kingdom's constitutional arrangements".[206][207]

        In practice it would be politically difficult for the UK Parliament to abolish devolution to the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd because these institutions were created by referendums.[208] The political constraints placed upon the UK Parliament's power to interfere with devolution in Northern Ireland are greater still, because devolution in Northern Ireland rests upon an international agreement with the Government of Ireland.[209] The UK Parliament restricts the three devolved parliaments' legislative powers in economic policy matters through an act passed in 2020.[210]

        England
        Unlike Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, England does not have a separate devolved government or national parliament,[211] rather a process of devolution of powers from the central government to local authorities has taken place, first in 1998.[212] The Greater London Authority (GLA) was set up following a referendum in 1998. Colloquially known as City Hall, it is the devolved regional government body for Greater London. It consists of two political branches: an Executive Mayor and the London Assembly, which serves as a check and balance on the Mayor.

        A Combined Authority (CA) is a type of local government institution introduced in England outside Greater London by the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009. CAs allow a group of local authorities to pool appropriate responsibility and receive certain devolved functions from central government in order to deliver transport and economic policy more effectively over a wider area.[213] A Combined County Authority (CCA) is a similar type of local-government institution introduced in England outside Greater London by the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023, but may only be formed by upper-tier authorities: county councils and unitary authorities.[214]

        Scotland
        Main article: Responsibilities of the Scottish Government

        Prime Minister Keir Starmer meets with First Minister of Scotland John Swinney, the head of the Scottish Government, at Bute House, Edinburgh.
        Since 1999 Scotland has had a devolved national government and parliament with wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the UK Parliament.[215][216] Scotland has the most devolved powers of any of the three devolved parliaments in the United Kingdom, with full legislative control over education, law and order, the economy, healthcare, elections, Crown Estate Scotland, the planning system and housing.[217]

        Additional powers were transferred to the Scottish Parliament via the Scotland Act 2012 and the Scotland Act 2016, such as some taxation powers, including full control of income tax on income earned through employment, Land and Buildings Transaction Tax, Landfill Tax, Aggregates Levy, Air Departure Tax and Revenue Scotland, as well as aspects of the energy network, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and onshore oil and gas licensing.[218][219] Their power over economic issues is significantly constrained by an act of the UK Parliament passed in 2020.[210]

        The Scottish Government is a Scottish National Party (SNP) minority government,[227] led by the first minister, currently John Swinney, the leader of the SNP. In 2014 the Scottish independence referendum was held, with 55.3 per cent voting against independence from the United Kingdom and 44.7 per cent voting in favour, resulting in Scotland staying within the United Kingdom. Local government in Scotland is divided into 32 council areas with a wide variation in size and population. Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are 1,223.[197]

        The Scottish Parliament is separate from the Scottish Government. It is made up of 129 elected members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). It is the law-making body of Scotland, and thus it scrutinises the work of the incumbent Scottish Government and considers any piece of proposed legislation through parliamentary debates, committees and parliamentary questions.[228]

        Wales
        Since 1999 Wales has had a devolved national government and legislature, known as the Senedd. Elections to the Senedd use the additional member system. It has more limited powers than those devolved to Scotland.[229] The Senedd can legislate on any matter not specifically reserved to the UK Parliament by Acts of Senedd Cymru. The Welsh Government is currently a Welsh Labour minority government led by the first minister, Eluned Morgan. Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself.

        Northern Ireland
        The devolved form of government in Northern Ireland is based on the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which brought to an end a 30-year period of unionist-nationalist communal conflict known as the Troubles. The Agreement was confirmed by referendum and implemented later that year. It established power sharing arrangements for a devolved government and legislature, referred to as the Northern Ireland Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly respectively.[230] Elections to the Assembly use the single transferable vote system. The Executive and Assembly have powers similar to those devolved to Scotland.[231] The Executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the Assembly.[232] The first minister and deputy first minister of Northern Ireland are the joint heads of government of Northern Ireland.[233][234] Local government in Northern Ireland since 2015 has been divided between 11 councils with limited responsibilities.[199]

        Foreign relations
        Main article: Foreign relations of the United Kingdom

        UK prime minister Keir Starmer and US president Donald Trump shaking hands in a joint press conference in 2025. The UK and the United States share a "Special Relationship".
        The UK is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a member of NATO, AUKUS, the Commonwealth of Nations, the G7, the G20, the OECD, the WTO, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.[235] The UK maintains the British Council, a British organisation in over 100 countries specialising in international cultural and educational opportunities. The UK remains a great power with considerable political, cultural, economic and military influence.[236][237]

        The UK is said to have a "Special Relationship" with the United States and a close partnership with France – the "Entente cordiale" – and shares nuclear weapons technology with both countries;[238][239] the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance is considered to be the oldest binding military alliance in the world. The UK is also closely linked with the Republic of Ireland; the two countries share a Common Travel Area and co-operate through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British-Irish Council. Britain's global presence and influence is further amplified through its trading relations, foreign investments, official development assistance and military engagements.[240] Canada, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are former colonies of the British Empire which share King Charles III as their head of state, are the most favourably viewed countries in the world by British people.[241]

        Law and criminal justice

        The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and for Scottish civil cases.
        The United Kingdom does not have a single legal system as Article 19 of the 1706 Treaty of Union provided for the continuation of Scotland's separate legal system.[242] The UK has three distinct systems of law: English law, Northern Ireland law and Scots law. A new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom came into being in October 2009 to replace the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords.[243] The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, including the same members as the Supreme Court, is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the British Overseas Territories and the Crown Dependencies.[244]

        Both English law, which applies in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland law are based on common law (or case law) principles.[245] It originated in England in the Middle Ages and is the basis for many legal systems around the world.[246] The courts of England and Wales are headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice for civil cases and the Crown Court for criminal cases.[247] Scots law is a hybrid system based on common-law and civil-law principles. The chief courts are the Court of Session, for civil cases,[248] and the High Court of Justiciary, for criminal cases.[249] The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law.[250]

        Crime in England and Wales increased between 1981 and 1995. Since that peak there has been an overall fall of 66% in recorded crime from 1995 to 2015,[251] according to UK crime statistics. As of June 2023, the United Kingdom has the highest per-capita incarceration rate in Western Europe.[252][253][254]

        UK labour laws establish employment rights including a minimum wage, a minimum of 28 days annual holiday, parental leave, statutory sick pay and a pension. Same-sex marriage has been legal in England, Scotland, and Wales since 2014, and in Northern Ireland since 2020.[255] LGBT equality in the United Kingdom is considered advanced by modern standards.[256][257]

        Since leaving the EU most disputes under UK-EU agreements are addressed through consultation between the parties. If consultation fails to resolve the issue, either party can request arbitration, typically at the PCA in The Hague.[129][258][259] The EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement states that the UK and EU have to cooperate and negotiate with each other with 'full mutual respect and good faith', as defined by international law.[260] Under the Windsor Framework, Northern Ireland matters requiring interpretation of EU law go to the ECJ, though the Stormont Brake can prevent new EU rules from taking effect.

        Overseas military installations of the United Kingdom, and locally raised units of the British Overseas Territories
        Military interventions since 2000: Palliser (Sierra Leone); Herrick (Afghanistan); Enduring Freedom (Horn of Africa); Telic (Iraq); Ellamy (Libya); and Shader (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant).
        The British Armed Forces consist of three professional service branches: the Royal Navy and Royal Marines (forming the Naval Service), the British Army and the Royal Air Force.[261] The armed forces of the United Kingdom are managed by the Ministry of Defence and controlled by the Defence Council, chaired by the Secretary of State for Defence. The Commander-in-Chief is the British monarch, to whom members of the forces swear an oath of allegiance.[262]

        The Armed Forces are charged with protecting the UK and its overseas territories, promoting the UK's global security interests and supporting international peacekeeping efforts. They are active and regular participants in NATO (including the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps), the Five Power Defence Arrangements, RIMPAC and other worldwide coalition operations. Overseas garrisons and facilities are maintained in Ascension Island, Bahrain, Belize, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Diego Garcia, the Falkland Islands, Germany, Gibraltar, Kenya, Oman, Qatar and Singapore.[263]

        According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute[264] and the International Institute for Strategic Studies,[265] the UK had the world's sixth- or fifth-highest military expenditures in 2024. Total defence spending in 2024 was estimated at 2.3 per cent of gross domestic product.[266] Following the end of the Cold War, defence policy has a stated assumption that "the most demanding operations" will be undertaken as part of a coalition.[267]

        City of London skyline from London City Hall. London is Europe's largest financial centre.[268]
        The UK has a highly developed social market economy.[269][270] With an estimated nominal GDP of £2.765 trillion in 2024,[271] it is the sixth-largest national economy in the world and the second-largest in Europe. Its currency, the pound sterling, is the fourth-most-traded currency in the foreign exchange market and the world's fourth-largest reserve currency, after the United States dollar, the euro and the yen.[272] The pound sterling maintains its high nominal value through both its long history of stability and by never undergoing formal redenomination. Since 2022 the UK has been both the world's fourth-largest exporter[273] and fourth-largest importer[274] of goods and services. Despite having one of the highest levels of income inequality in the OECD,[275][276] the UK has a very high HDI ranking, even when adjusted for inequality. As of 2025 the UK unemployment rate is 4.7%,[277] which is moderately low by European standards.


        The Bank of England is the central bank of the United Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based.
        HM Treasury, led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance and economic policy. The Department for Business and Trade is responsible for business, international trade, and enterprise. The Bank of England is the UK's central bank and responsible for issuing notes and coins in the pound sterling. Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover their issue. The Bank of England is exploring a digital pound to enable instant settlement and improve payment infrastructure.[278]

        Industries and services
        The service sector made up around 80 per cent of the UK's GVA in 2023.[279] As of 2023 it is the world's second-largest exporter of services[280] and in 2024 was the world's largest net exporter of financial services.[281] In 2023 the UK was 13 per cent above its pre-pandemic and pre-Brexit peak in 2019 for service exports.[282] London is the world capital for foreign exchange trading, with a market share of 38.1 per cent in 2022[283] of the daily US$7.5 trillion global turnover.[284] It is the largest urban economy in Europe[285] and, alongside New York, the city in the world most integrated with the global economy.[286] London is also one of the world's leading financial centres, ranking second in the 2025 Global Financial Centres Index.[287] Edinburgh, the UK's second-largest financial centre, ranks 29th in the world and tenth in Western Europe in the same index.[287]

        The UK's manufacturing sector in 2024 was the world's 10th-largest and Europe's fourth-largest by value output.[288] Due to a period of high domestic inflation caused by COVID-19, high energy prices and supply chain shocks, the UK imported and exported less goods in 2023 than in 2018.[289][290] At the end of 2024 manufacturing in the United Kingdom accounted for 8 per cent of the workforce and 8.6 per cent of national economic output.[291] As reported in 2017 the East Midlands and West Midlands (at 12.6 and 11.8 per cent respectively) were the regions with the highest proportion of employees in manufacturing. London's manufacturing sector had the lowest at 2.8 per cent.[292]

        The country's tourism sector is very important to the British economy;[293] London was named Europe's most popular destination for 2022.[294] The creative industries accounted for 5.9 per cent of the UK's GVA in 2019, having grown by 43.6 per cent in real terms from 2010.[295] Creative industries contributed more than £111 billion to the UK economy in 2018, and the sector grew more than five times faster than the UK economy overall in that year.[296] Lloyd's of London, located in London, is the world's largest insurance and reinsurance market.[297] WPP plc is one of the world's biggest advertising companies and also based in London.[298] The UK is one of the leading retail markets in Europe and Europe's largest e-commerce market.[299] With consumption expenditures of over US$2 trillion in 2023, it has the second-largest consumer market in Europe.[300] John Lewis is the UK's largest employee-owned business.[301]

        The British automotive industry employs 813,000 people, with a turnover in 2023 of £93 billion, generating £47 billion of exports (12 per cent of the UK's total exports of goods).[302] In 2024 the UK produced 779,584 passenger vehicles and 125,649 commercial vehicles; 8 out of 10 cars produced in the UK are exported overseas.[302] Britain is known for iconic cars like Mini and Jaguar,[303] as well as luxury cars such as Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Range Rover. The UK is a major centre for engine manufacturing: 1.59 million engines were produced in 2024.[302] It was the world's third-largest exporter of engines in 2023.[304] The UK motorsport industry employs more than 40,000 people, comprises around 4,300 companies and has an annual turnover of around £10 billion.[305] Seven of the ten Formula One teams are based in the UK, with their technology being used in supercars and hypercars from McLaren, Aston Martin and Lotus.[u] In 2024 the UK surpassed Germany to become the largest market for electric vehicles in Europe.[306]


        Concorde was a supersonic airliner that reduced transatlantic flight time from 8 hours to 3.5 hours.[307]
        The aerospace industry of the UK is the second-largest in the world[308] and has an annual turnover of around £30 billion.[309] The UK space industry was worth £17.5 billion in 2020/21 and employed around 48,800 people.[310][311] Since 2012 the number of space organisations has grown on average nearly 21 per cent per year, with 1,293 organisations reported in 2021.[312][313] The UK Space Agency has stated in 2023 that it is investing £1.6 billion in space-related projects.[314]

        The British agriculture industry is intensive, highly mechanised and efficient by European standards, producing approximately 60 per cent of the country's overall food requirements and 73 per cent of its indigenous food needs, utilising around 0.9 per cent of the labour force (292,000 workers).[315] Around two-thirds of production is devoted to livestock and one-third to arable crops. The UK retains a significant though much reduced fishing industry, with at least 49 per cent of UK fish sustainably caught in 2020.[316] The UK marine natural capital assets were estimated to have a value of £211 billion in 2021.[317] It is rich in a variety of other natural resources including coal, petroleum, natural gas, tin, limestone, iron ore, salt, clay, chalk, gypsum, lead, and silica and has an abundance of arable land.[318]

        Science and technology
        Main articles: Science and technology in the United Kingdom and Telecommunications in the United Kingdom

        The Cambridge Cluster is the most intensive research cluster for science and technology in the world.[319]
        England and Scotland were leading centres of the Scientific Revolution from the 17th century.[320] The United Kingdom led the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century, and has continued to produce scientists and engineers credited with important advances.[321] Major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include Isaac Newton, whose laws of motion and illumination of gravity have been seen as a keystone of modern science;[322] from the 19th century Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection was fundamental to the development of modern biology, and James Clerk Maxwell, who formulated classical electromagnetic theory; and more recently Stephen Hawking, who advanced major theories in the fields of cosmology, quantum gravity and the investigation of black holes.[323]

        The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) is responsible for helping to encourage, develop and manage the UK's scientific, research, and technological outputs. Scientific research and development remains important in British universities, with many establishing science parks to facilitate production and co-operation with industry.[324] During 2022 the UK produced 6.3 per cent of the world's scientific research papers and had a 10.5 per cent share of scientific citations, the third highest in the world for both. The UK ranked 1st in the world for Field-Weighted Citation Impact.[325] Scientific journals produced in the UK include publications by the Royal Society, Nature, the British Medical Journal and The Lancet.[326]

        In 2022 the UK reached the milestone of a combined market value of US$1 trillion for its startup and scaleup ecosystem.[327] By 2024 the UK tech sector reached a value of US$1.2 trillion surpassing the combined values of the French and German sectors.[328] Cambridge was named the number one university in the world for producing successful technology founders.[329] The UK's artificial intelligence industry is the largest in Europe by value.[330] The country ranked third globally in a 2024 report on artificial intelligence development by Stanford University.[331] In 2025 the UK ranked 6th in the Global Innovation Index.[332][333] In 2025 the "Tech Prosperity Deal" was announced where US companies pledged £150 billion of investment in the UK.[334]

        A radial road network totals 29,145 miles (46,904 km) of main roads, 2,173 miles (3,497 km) of motorways and 213,750 miles (344,000 km) of paved roads.[138] The M25, encircling London, is the largest and busiest bypass in the world.[335] In 2024 there were 41.7 million licensed vehicles in the UK.[336]


        A high-speed East Coast Main Line train in Northumberland, England
        The UK has an extensive railway network of 10,072 miles (16,209 km). In Great Britain, the British Rail network was privatised between 1994 and 1997, followed by a rapid rise in passengers. Great British Railways is a planned state-owned public body that will oversee rail transport in Great Britain. The UK was ranked eighth amongst national European rail systems in the 2017 European Railway Performance Index assessing intensity of use, quality of service and safety.[337]

        The UK has a train direct from London to Paris which takes 2 hours and 16 minutes[338] called the Eurostar, it travels through the Channel Tunnel under the English Channel, at 23.5 miles long it is the world's longest undersea tunnel.[339] There is also a car service through the tunnel to France called LeShuttle. The Elizabeth line, a rail link running between East and West London, was named in honour of Queen Elizabeth II in 2016 and opened in 2022. It was Europe's largest construction project at the time and is estimated to bring in £42 billion to the UK economy.[340][341] Another major infrastructure project is High Speed 2 (HS2), a high-speed railway under construction since 2019. It will link London with Birmingham, with the potential to extend further north and capable of speeds of up to 225 mph.[342][343]

        In 2023 there were 4 billion bus journeys in the UK, 1.8 billion of which were in London.[344] The red double-decker bus has entered popular culture as an internationally recognised icon of London and England.[345] The London bus network is extensive, with over 6,800 scheduled services every weekday carrying about 6 million passengers on over 700 different routes, making it one of the most extensive bus systems in the world and the largest in Europe.[346]


        A plane taking off from London City Airport. London's airports make it the city with the busiest airport system in the world.
        During 2024 British airports handled nearly 292.5 million passengers.[347] In that period the three largest airports were London Heathrow Airport (83.9 million passengers), Gatwick Airport (43.2 million passengers) and Manchester Airport (30.8 million passengers).[347] London Heathrow Airport, located 15 miles (24 km) west of the capital, is the world's second-busiest airport by international passenger traffic and has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the world;[348] it is the hub for the UK flag carrier British Airways, as well as Virgin Atlantic.[349] During 2023, 18.3 million passengers travelled internationally by rail and 18.1 million by sea.[350]

        Energy
        Main article: Energy in the United Kingdom
        Further information: Energy in England, Energy in Scotland, Energy in Northern Ireland, and Energy in Wales
        In 2021 the UK was the world's 14th-largest consumer and 22nd-largest producer of energy.[351] It is home to many large energy companies, including two of the six major oil and gas companies – BP and Shell.[352]


        Wind turbines overlooking Ardrossan in Scotland. The UK is a major producer of wind energy in Europe.[353]
        Renewable electricity sources provided 51 per cent of the electricity generated in the UK in 2024. Wind power was the largest source of electricity in 2024, generating 30 per cent of the UK's total electricity.[354] The UK has the largest offshore wind farm in the world, which is located off the coast of Yorkshire.[355]

        In 2023 the UK had nine nuclear reactors generating about 15 per cent of the UK's electricity.[356] There are two reactors under construction and more planned.[357][358] In the late 1990s nuclear power plants contributed around 25 per cent of the total annual electricity generation in the UK, but this has gradually declined as old plants have been shut down. The UK government is investing in small modular reactors that operate via nuclear fission, as well as in research and development towards commercial fusion reactors. To that end the government entered into a partnership with the US in late 2023 to collaborate on fusion technology, with "a commercial grid-ready fusion reactor by 2040" stated as a goal.[359]

        At the end of 2023 it was estimated that there were 1.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent of "proven" and "probable" gas reserves and 2.3 billion boe of "proven" and "probable" oil reserves offshore, reducing reliance on imports for energy security and transitioning to renewables.[360] Emissions from UK gas production are roughly four times lower than imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), according to the UK's oil and gas regulator.[361]

        In September 2024 the last coal power station was closed, making coal no longer a power source in the UK.[354] The UK currently has no fracking (hydraulic fracturing) for shale gas despite a large supply, due to environmental concerns.[362]

        Water supply and sanitation
        Main article: Water supply and sanitation in the United Kingdom
        Access to improved water supply and sanitation in the UK is universal. It is estimated that 96 per cent of households are connected to the sewer network.[363] According to the Environment Agency, total water abstraction for public water supply in the UK was 16,406 megalitres per day in 2007.[364]

        In England and Wales, water and sewerage services are provided by 10 private regional water and sewerage companies and 13 mostly smaller private "water only" companies. In Scotland, said services are provided by a single public company, Scottish Water. In Northern Ireland, they are also provided by a single public entity, Northern Ireland Water.[365]

        Development of ethnicities in the United Kingdom (1951–2021)
        Historically, indigenous British people were thought to be descended from ethnic groups that settled there before the 12th century: the Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Norse and the Normans. Welsh people could be the oldest ethnic group in the UK.[381] The UK has a history of non-white immigration with Liverpool having the oldest black population in the country dating from at least the 1730s,[382] in addition to having the oldest Chinese community in Europe dating from the 19th century.[383]

        In 2021, 83 per cent of the UK population identified themselves as white, meaning 17 per cent of the UK population identify themselves as of one of an ethnic minority group.[384] Ethnic diversity varies significantly across the UK. Regionally, in 2021, 46.2 per cent of London's population was an ethnic minority, comparatively to Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the South West and North East of England being less than 10 per cent.[384]

        Language
        Main article: Languages of the United Kingdom
        The English language is the de facto official and most widely spoken language in the United Kingdom.[385][386] The UK promotes the language globally to build connections, understanding and trust between people in the UK and countries worldwide.[387][388]

        In the UK, the English language is spoken with distinctive characteristics that collectively form what is known as British English. The variety of dialects and accents is often noted, with nearby regions frequently having highly distinct variations. Received Pronunciation is traditionally associated with educated speakers in southern England.[389] The main national dialects are Scottish English, Welsh English and Northern Irish English. Distinctive regional varieties include Brummie, Cockney, Geordie, Mancunian, Scouse, West Country, Yorkshire and MLE (Multicultural London English).[390]

        Three indigenous Celtic languages are spoken in the UK: Welsh, Irish and Scottish Gaelic. Cornish, which became extinct as a first language in the late-18th century, is being revived and has a small group of second-language speakers.[391][2] In the 2021 census the Welsh-speaking population of Wales aged three or older was 538,300 (17.8 per cent).[392] In addition it is estimated that about 200,000 Welsh-speakers live in England.[393] In the 2021 census in Northern Ireland 12.4 per cent of people had some Irish language ability and 10.4 per cent of people had some facility in the Ulster-Scots language.[394]

        In 2001, over 92,000 people in Scotland, just under 2 per cent of the population, had some Gaelic language ability, including 72 per cent of those living in the Outer Hebrides.[395] The number of children being taught either Welsh or Scottish Gaelic is increasing.[396] Scots, a language descended from early northern Middle English, has limited recognition alongside its regional variant, Ulster Scots in Northern Ireland, without specific commitments to protection and promotion.[2][397] As of April 2020 there are around 151,000 users of British Sign Language (BSL), a sign language used by deaf people, in the UK.[398]

        In 2013, it was estimated that 95 per cent of the UK's population were monolingual English speakers.[399] In 2013, over 5 per cent of the population were estimated to speak languages brought to the UK as a result of immigration.[399] South Asian languages are the largest group, which includes Punjabi, Urdu, Bengali, Sylheti, Hindi, Pahari-Pothwari, Tamil and Gujarati.[400] In the 2011 census Polish was the second-largest language spoken in England, with 546,000 speakers.[401] In 2019 some three-quarters of a million people spoke little or no English.[402]

        Religion
        Main article: Religion in the United Kingdom
        Religion in the United Kingdom (2022 census):[403]
        Christianity (46.5%)
        No religion (37.8%)
        Islam (5.97%)
        Hinduism (1.59%)
        Sikhism (0.79%)
        Buddhism (0.43%)
        Judaism (0.41%)
        Other religion (0.58%)
        Not stated (5.91%)
        Christianity has dominated religious life in the United Kingdom for more than 1,400 years.[404] Although a majority of citizens still identify with Christianity in surveys, regular church attendance has fallen dramatically since the middle of the 20th century,[405] while immigration and demographic change have contributed to the growth of Islam and other faiths.[406] This has led some commentators to describe the UK as a multi-faith,[407] secularised,[408] or post-Christian society.[409]

        In the 2021 census 46.5 per cent of respondents reported that they were Christians, with the next largest faiths being Islam (5.9 per cent), Hinduism (1.6 per cent), Sikhism (0.8 per cent), Buddhism (0.4 per cent), Judaism (0.4 per cent), and all other religions (0.6 per cent). Of the respondents, 38 per cent stated that they had no religion and a further 6 per cent stated no religious preference.[7] A Tearfund survey in 2007 showed that one Briton in ten attends church weekly.[410] Between the 2001 and 2011 censuses there was a 12 per cent decrease in those who identified as Christian, while the percentage reporting no religious affiliation doubled. This contrasted with growth in the other main religious group categories, with the number of Muslims increasing the most to about 5 per cent.[411] The Muslim population has increased from 1.6 million in 2001 to 2.7 million in 2011, making it the second-largest religious group in the UK.[412]

        The Church of England is the established church.[413] It retains representation in the UK Parliament, and the British monarch is its Supreme Governor.[414] In Scotland the Church of Scotland is the national church. It is not subject to state control, and the British monarch is an ordinary member, required to swear an oath to "maintain and preserve the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Government" upon his or her accession.[415][2][416] The Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920 and, because the Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1870 before the partition of Ireland, there is no established church in Northern Ireland.[417] Although there are no UK-wide data in the 2001 census on adherence to individual Christian denominations, it has been estimated that 62 per cent of Christians are Anglican, 13.5 per cent Catholic, 6 per cent Presbyterian, and 3.4 per cent Methodist, with smaller numbers of other denominations.[418]

        Estimated foreign-born population by country of birth from April 2007 to March 2008

        Estimated number of British citizens living overseas by country in 2006
        Immigration is contributing to a rising UK population,[419][420] with arrivals and UK-born children of migrants accounting for about half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001. According to statistics released in 2015, 27 per cent of UK live births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the UK.[421]

        In 2013 approximately 208,000 foreign nationals were naturalised as British citizens, the highest number since 1962. This figure fell to around 125,800 in 2014. Between 2009 and 2013 the average number of British citizenships granted annually was 195,800. The most common origins of those naturalised in 2024 were Pakistani, Indian, Nigerian, Filipino, Bangladeshi, Italian, Turkish, Romanian and Iranian. The number of grants of settlement, which confer permanent residence in the UK but not citizenship,[422] was approximately 154,700 in 2013, higher than the previous two years.[423] Long-term net migration (the number of people immigrating minus the number emigrating) reached a record of 860,000 in 2023, with immigration at 1.326 million and emigration at 466,000. In comparison, in 2024 net migration was estimated to be 431,000 with immigration at 948,000 and emigration at 517,000.[424]

        Emigration was an important feature of British society in the 19th century. Between 1815 and 1930, around 11.4 million people emigrated from Britain and 7.3 million from Ireland.[425][426] Estimates show that by the end of the 20th century, some 300 million people of British and Irish descent were permanently settled around the globe.[426] In 2006 at least 5.5 million UK-born people lived abroad,[427][428] mainly in Australia, Spain, the United States and Canada.[427][429]

        The University of Oxford is widely regarded as one of the world's leading universities.
        Education in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with each country having a separate education system. About 38 per cent of the United Kingdom population has a university or college degree, which is the highest percentage in Europe, and amongst the highest percentage in the world.[430] The UK is home to many universities, including the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge, which often achieve first place on global rankings.[431][432]

        University education has varied tuition fees in different regions of the UK. England and Wales have a fixed maximum annual fee for all UK citizens, contingent on attaining a certain level of income. Only those who reach a certain salary threshold pay this fee through general taxation.[433] Northern Ireland and Scotland have a reduced maximum fee or no fee for citizens where it is their home region. Some NHS courses have bursaries which pay the fee and in 2017 it was stated that each doctor gets subsidised by £230,000 during their training.[434][435]

        In 2022 the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), coordinated by the OECD, ranked the overall knowledge and skills of British 15-year-olds as 14th in the world in reading, mathematics and science. The average British student scored 494, above the OECD average of 478.[436][437]

        Healthcare

        NHS Scotland's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, the largest hospital campus in Europe
        The modern system of universal publicly funded healthcare in the United Kingdom has its origins in the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1949 is the primary healthcare provider in the United Kingdom. The widespread popularity of the NHS has led to it being described as a "national religion".[438][439] Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter and each constituent country has its own system of universal publicly funded healthcare, although private healthcare is also available. Public healthcare is provided to all UK permanent residents and is mostly free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. The World Health Organization, in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth-best in Europe and eighteenth in the world.[440]

        Since 1979 expenditure on healthcare has increased significantly.[441] The 2018 OECD data, which incorporates in health a chunk of what in the UK is classified as social care, has the UK spending £3,121 per person.[442] In 2017 the UK spent £2,989 per person on healthcare, near the median for members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.[443]

        Regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the General Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council and non-governmental-based, such as the Royal Colleges. Political and operational responsibility for healthcare lies with four national executives; healthcare in England is the responsibility of the UK Government; healthcare in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive; healthcare in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Government; and healthcare in Wales is the responsibility of the Welsh Government. Each National Health Service has different policies and priorities.[444]

        Culture
        Main article: Culture of the United Kingdom
        The culture of the United Kingdom is influenced by the nation's island status, its history, and being a political union of four countries with each preserving distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism. British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies, in particular, the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Ireland, a common culture known as the Anglosphere.[445][446] The UK's soft power influence has led to the country being described as a cultural superpower.[109][110] A global survey in 2024 ranked the UK 3rd in the 'Most Influential Countries' rankings, behind the US and China.[447]

        British literature includes that associated with the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Most British literature is in English. In 2022, 669 million physical books were sold in the UK, which is the most ever.[448] Britain is renowned for children's literature; writers include Daniel Defoe, Rudyard Kipling, Lewis Carroll and Beatrix Potter, who also illustrated her own books. Other writers include A. A. Milne, Enid Blyton, J. R. R. Tolkien, Roald Dahl, Terry Pratchett and J. K. Rowling, who wrote Harry Potter, the best-selling book series of all time.[449]

        The playwright and poet William Shakespeare is generally regarded as the greatest dramatist ever and the national poet of England.[450] Other important figures in the literature of England are Geoffrey Chaucer, known for The Canterbury Tales, the poet William Wordsworth, and other Romantic poets, also the novelists Charles Dickens, H. G. Wells, George Orwell, Aldous Huxley and Ian Fleming. The 20th-century English crime writer Agatha Christie is the best-selling novelist in history.[451] Twelve of the top 25 of 100 novels by British writers chosen by a BBC poll of global critics were written by women; these included works by George Eliot, Virginia Woolf, Charlotte Brontë, Emily Brontë, Mary Shelley, Jane Austen, Doris Lessing and Zadie Smith.[452]

        Scottish literature includes Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of Sherlock Holmes), Sir Walter Scott, J. M. Barrie, Robert Louis Stevenson (whose novel Treasure Island strongly influenced the portrayal of pirates in the arts and popular culture), and the poet Robert Burns, who is considered the national poet of Scotland. More recently Hugh MacDiarmid and Neil M. Gunn contributed to the Scottish Renaissance, with grimmer works from Ian Rankin and Iain Banks. Edinburgh was UNESCO's first worldwide City of Literature.[453]

        Welsh literature includes Britain's oldest known poem, Y Gododdin, which was composed most likely in the late 6th century. It was written in Cumbric or Old Welsh and contains the earliest known reference to King Arthur.[454] The Arthurian legend was further developed by Geoffrey of Monmouth.[455] Dafydd ap Gwilym (fl. 1320–1370) is widely regarded as one of the greatest European poets of his age.[456] Daniel Owen is credited as the first Welsh-language novelist, publishing Rhys Lewis in 1885. The best-known of the Anglo-Welsh poets are Dylan Thomas and R. S. Thomas, the latter nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1996. Leading Welsh novelists of the twentieth century include Richard Llewellyn and Kate Roberts.[457][458]

        Northern Ireland's most popular writer is C. S. Lewis, who was born in Belfast and wrote The Chronicles of Narnia.[459] Irish writers, living at a time when all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, include Oscar Wilde,[460] Bram Stoker (who wrote Dracula)[461] and George Bernard Shaw.[462] There have been many authors whose origins were from outside the United Kingdom but who moved to the UK, including Joseph Conrad,[463] T. S. Eliot,[464] Kazuo Ishiguro,[465] Sir Salman Rushdie[466] and Ezra Pound.[467]

        Philosophy
        Main article: British philosophy
        The United Kingdom is famous for "British Empiricism", a branch of the philosophy that states that only knowledge verified by experience is valid, and 'Scottish Philosophy', sometimes referred to as the 'Scottish School of Common Sense'.[468] The most famous philosophers of British Empiricism are John Locke, George Berkeley[v] and David Hume; while Dugald Stewart, Thomas Reid and William Hamilton were major exponents of the Scottish "common sense" school. Two Britons are also notable for the ethical theory of utilitarianism, a moral philosophy first used by Jeremy Bentham and later by John Stuart Mill in his short work Utilitarianism.[469]

        Music

        The Proms is a classical music festival, most closely associated with Henry Wood and held at the Royal Albert Hall in London, which regularly plays music by Edward Elgar and other British composers.
        Various styles of music have become popular in the UK, including the folk music of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. English folk features melodic ballads with strong lyrics and music for country dancing often using accordion and fiddles.[470] Scottish folk features bagpipes and fiddles playing traditional dance tunes with bouncy tempos.[471] Welsh folk has harps and vocal harmonies often sung in Welsh.[472] Northern Irish folk blends fiddles with flutes merging Scottish and Irish influences.[473]

        Historically, there has been Renaissance music from the Tudor period, with masses, madrigals and lute music by Thomas Tallis, John Taverner, William Byrd, Orlando Gibbons and John Dowland. After the Stuart Restoration, an English tradition of dramatic masques, anthems and airs became established, led by Henry Purcell, followed by Thomas Arne and others. George Frideric Handel composed the anthem Zadok the Priest for the coronation of George II; it became the traditional ceremonial music for anointing all future monarchs. Handel's many oratorios, such as his famous Messiah, were written in English.[474]

        In the second half of the 19th century, Arthur Sullivan and his librettist W. S. Gilbert wrote their popular Savoy operas, and Edward Elgar composed a wide range of music. Increasingly, composers became inspired by the English countryside and its folk music, notably Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Benjamin Britten, a pioneer of modern British opera. Amongst the many post-war composers, some of the most notable have made their own personal choice of musical identity: Peter Maxwell Davies (Orkney), Harrison Birtwistle (mythological), and John Tavener (religious).[475] Recent classical singers include Alfie Boe, Bryn Terfel, Katherine Jenkins, Michael Ball, Roderick Williams, Russell Watson and Sarah Brightman, while Nicola Benedetti and Nigel Kennedy are renowned for their violin ability.[476]

        According to The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians the term "pop music" originated in Britain in the mid-1950s to describe rock and roll's fusion with the "new youth music".[477] The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that artists such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones drove pop music to the forefront of popular music in the early 1960s.[478] Birmingham became known as the birthplace of heavy metal, with the band Black Sabbath starting there in the 1960s.[479] In the following years, Britain took part in the development of rock music, with British acts pioneering hard rock,[480] raga rock, heavy metal,[481] space rock, glam rock,[482] Gothic rock,[483] psychedelic rock[484] and punk rock.[485] British acts also developed neo soul and created dubstep.[486] The modern UK produces some of the most prominent English-speaking rappers along with the United States, including Stormzy, Kano, Yxng Bane, Ramz, Little Simz and Skepta.[487]


        The British-born singer Rod Stewart became one of the best-selling music artists worldwide.
        The Beatles have international sales of over 1 billion units and are the biggest-selling band, in addition to being widely regarded as the most influential band in the history of popular music.[488][489][490][491] Other prominent British contributors to popular music over the last 50 years include the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Queen, Led Zeppelin, the Bee Gees and Elton John, all of whom have worldwide record sales of 200 million or more.[492] The Brit Awards are the BPI's annual music awards, and some of the British recipients of the Outstanding Contribution to Music award include the Who, David Bowie, Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, the Police and Fleetwood Mac (who are a British-American band).[493] More recent UK music acts that have had international success include George Michael, Oasis, Spice Girls, Radiohead, Coldplay, Arctic Monkeys, Robbie Williams, Amy Winehouse, Susan Boyle, Adele, Ed Sheeran, Lewis Capaldi, One Direction, Harry Styles and Dua Lipa.[494]

        Many British cities are known for their music. Acts from Liverpool have had 54 UK chart number 1 hit singles, more per capita than any other city worldwide.[495] Glasgow's contribution was recognised in 2008 when it was named a City of Music by UNESCO.[496] Manchester played a role in the spread of dance music such as acid house, and from the mid-1990s, Britpop. London and Bristol are closely associated with the origins of electronic music sub-genres such as drum and bass and trip hop.[497]

        UK dance music traces its roots back to the black British Sound System Culture and the New Age Traveller movement of the 60s and 70s,[498] it also has influences from New Wave and Synth-pop such as from bands New Order and Depeche Mode[499] and also has influences from the Chicago House and Detroit Techno scenes. In the late 80's, dance music exploded with Rave culture mainly Acid House tracks which were made mainstream with novelty records (such as Smart E's Sesame's Treet and the Prodigy's Charly)[500] and the Balearic sound brought back from the Ibiza club scene. This led on to genres such as UK Garage, Speed Garage, Drum and bass, Jungle, Trance, and Dubstep. Influential UK dance acts past and present include 808 State, Orbital, the Prodigy, Underworld, Roni Size, Leftfield, Massive Attack, Groove Armada, Fatboy Slim, Faithless, Basement Jaxx, Chemical Brothers, Sub Focus, Chase & Status, Disclosure, Calvin Harris, and Fred Again.[501] Other influential UK DJs include Judge Jules, Pete Tong, Carl Cox, Paul Oakenfold, John Digweed and Sasha.[502]

        The United Kingdom has had a considerable influence on the history of the cinema. The British directors Alfred Hitchcock, whose film Vertigo is considered by some critics as the best film of all time,[505] and David Lean, who directed Lawrence of Arabia, are amongst the most critically acclaimed directors ever.[506] Recent popular directors include Christopher Nolan, Sam Mendes, Steve McQueen, Richard Curtis, Danny Boyle, Tony Scott and Ridley Scott.[507][508][509][510] Many British actors have achieved international fame and critical success. Some of the most commercially successful films have been produced in the United Kingdom, including two of the highest-grossing film franchises (Harry Potter and James Bond).[511]

        2019 was a particularly good year for British films which grossed around £10.3 billion globally, which was 28.7 per cent of global box office revenue.[512] UK box-office takings totalled £1.25 billion in 2019, with around 176 million admissions.[513] In 2023 UK film and television studio stage space stood at 6.9 million sq ft, with 1 million sq ft added in the past year with more in development.[514] The annual BAFTA Film Awards are hosted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.[515]

        Fish and chips, a traditional British dish, served with lemon, tartar sauce and mushy peas
        British cuisine developed from influences reflective of its land, settlements, arrivals of new settlers and immigrants, trade and colonialism. The food of England has historically been characterised by simplicity of approach and a reliance on the high quality of natural produce.[516] The traditional Sunday roast is one example, featuring a roast joint (usually of beef), lamb, chicken, or pork, often free range (and generally grass-fed, in the case of beef). Roasts are served with either roasted or boiled vegetables, Yorkshire pudding and gravy. Other traditional meals include meat pies and stews. A poll by YouGov in 2019 rated classic British food, with more than 80 per cent liking the Sunday roast, Yorkshire pudding, fish and chips, crumpets and the full English breakfast.[517]

        The UK is home to a large selection of fine dining. In 2025 there were 197 restaurants with a Michelin Star; 55 of them consider their cuisine to be 'Modern British'.[518] Sweet foods are common within British cuisine, and there is a long list of British desserts. Afternoon tea is a light afternoon meal served with tea in tea rooms and hotels around the United Kingdom, with the tradition dating back to around 1840.[519] A poll from July 2024 revealed that 3 per cent of the UK population follow a vegan diet, 6 per cent are vegetarian, and 13 per cent identify as flexitarian (following a mainly vegetarian diet).[520] The British Empire facilitated knowledge of Indian cuisine with its "strong, penetrating spices and herbs". British cuisine has absorbed the cultural influence of those who have settled in Britain, producing hybrid dishes, such as chicken tikka masala.[521] The British have embraced world cuisine and regularly eat recipes or fast food from other European countries, the Caribbean and Asia.

        The UK has many gastropubs and is the birthplace of many alcoholic drinks including several beer styles such as pale ale, India pale ale, bitter, brown ale, porter, and stout. The number of craft beers and microbreweries has expanded rapidly in the last two decades.[522] Other popular alcoholic drinks produced in the UK include Scotch whisky, English wine, gin, perry and cider.

        A poll in 2003 found that football is the most popular sport in the UK.[540] England is recognised by FIFA as the birthplace of club football, and the Football Association is the oldest of its kind, with the rules of football first drafted in 1863 by Ebenezer Cobb Morley.[541] Each of the Home Nations (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) has its own football association, national team and league system, and each is individually a governing member of the International Football Association Board alongside FIFA. The English top division, the Premier League, is the most watched football league in the world.[542] The first international football match was contested by England and Scotland on 30 November 1872.[543] England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland usually compete as separate countries in international competitions.[544]

        In 2003 rugby union was ranked the second-most-popular sport in the UK.[540] The sport was created in Rugby School, Warwickshire, and the first rugby international took place on 27 March 1871 between England and Scotland.[545][546] England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France and Italy compete in the Six Nations Championship, which is the premier international rugby union tournament in the northern hemisphere. Sports governing bodies in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland organise and regulate the game separately.[547] Every four years the Home Nations make a combined team known as the British and Irish Lions which tours Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

        Union Jack flags on The Mall, London
        The flag of the United Kingdom is the Union Flag, which is also referred to as the Union Jack.[549] It was created in 1606 by the superimposition of the flag of England, representing Saint George, on the flag of Scotland, representing Saint Andrew, and was updated in 1801 with the addition of Saint Patrick's Flag.[550] Wales is not represented in the Union Flag, as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom. The possibility of redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales was discussed in 2007.[551] The national anthem of the United Kingdom is "God Save the King", with "King" replaced with "Queen" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is a woman.

        Britannia is a national personification of the United Kingdom, originating from Roman Britain.[552] Beside The Lion and the Unicorn and the dragon of heraldry, the bulldog is an iconic animal and commonly represented with the Union Flag.[553] A rare personification is a character originating in the 18th century, John Bull.[554]

        England, Wales and Scotland each have their own national symbols, including their national flags. Northern Ireland also has symbols, many of which are shared with the Republic of Ireland.
